#Chapter Two: The Phenomenology of Netto-Uyoku, a literature review



To demonstrate the extent of reach the Netto-Uyoku have had, this paper's introduction briefly touched upon an English-language print article in The New York Times. It goes without saying the term has been in use since much earlier. The first English-language mention in mainstream media can be traced back to March. 14, 2006, when Journalist Eric Johnston wrote a piece for The Japan Times on right-wing nationalism and the Internet in Japan, "Net boards venue for faceless rightists". In his piece, Johnston associates these 'faceless rightists' (who he further refers to as *Net Uyoku*) with hate-speech towards Koreans, the anonymous Internet forum *2Channel*, online video platform *Channel Sakura* and the conservative political organization *Nippon Kaigi* [@johnston_net_2006]. These topics are presented to some extent in virtually all writings I will review. 
In Japan, the term first reached print press in a 2005 Mainichi Shimbun article by @sasaki_netto-uyoku_2005, a journalist with a lengthy publishing record on Japanese Internet discourse:[^4]

 Whereas earlier works viewed the Netto-Uyoku in a greater debate of (trans)national identity, discrimination and of questions to what qualifies as freedom of speech [@tsuji_eng:_2008;@yasuda_eng:_2012;@morris-suzuki_beyond_2015], recent works focus on the Netto-Uyoku as an actual social group.

In one of the first English language academic writings on the topic, Tessa Morris-Suzuki [-@morris-suzuki_freedom_2013] warns against the dangers of social media as a tool for populist mobilization, and paradoxical usage of "freedom of speech". While not explicitly using the term Netto-Uyoku or *net-right*, she describes trends of "violently xenophobic or racist messages, recycling wartime language and imagery that had long disappeared from public discourse in Japan" on the anonymous Internet forum 2channel as a trend of *Internet nationalism* . Based on a 2012 social media white paper showcasing 2channel users to be predominantly young and male, she then frames Netto-Uyoku as "lonely, frustrated *otaku* (an isolated person with obsessive interests), probably unemployed or in a dead-end job, seeking some sense of identity by sharing anger and bitterness with nameless others". She further hints that as the social media-scape shifts, so too then finds this 2channel-inspired Netto-Uyoku discourse its way to other platforms. The image of the lonely Netto-Uyoku as an *otaku* seeking comfort in nationalism and group-bonding online is indeed a compelling narrative, although purely speculative and of course highly stereotypical.

Like Yasuda Koichi, she ties 2channel to the ACM (or rather, the "emergence of new forms of far right movement in Japan") such as the Shinshakai Undo and more specifically the Zaitokukai. Of note to her is the Zaitokukai's active use of social media for propagating ideology, hinting a radicalizing effect by claiming such media usage is how the Zaitokukai "recruit the young". Their usage of hate speech then, while through various interpretations of the Penal Code illegal, so argues Morris-Suzuki, goes unpunished "because such laws could limit freedom of speech". Finally she claims that, despite a lack of violence, these movements both on and offline should be taken seriously. Why? She recalls an incident in January 2001, when shortly before the planned public broadcast of an NHK documentary on wartime acts of violence against women by the Japan military, the national broadcast service NHK was forced to cut parts including testimony and preliminary findings. The reason for this, as turns out later, was an implied censorship and political interference by Abe Shinzo, unsupportive of the biased nature of the show. As the media-scape shifted, however, so too did Abe Shinzo and a number of Japanese politicians including Hashimoto Toru take "to social media with great enthusiasm".[^3] In particular, she recalls an incident in which Abe's secretary mobilized Abe's friends and followers on his Facebook page (at the time counting at respectively 4,800 and 230,000) for an online attack, again, on the NHK (including a *fake news* story of one panel member on the show). Rather than condemning this, and contradictory to his public statement of "Japan’s diplomacy must always be rooted in democracy" in 2012", Abe instead perpetuates this attack by responding to that public message on his Facebook with another *ad hominem* attack.[^1][^2]

As Japanese prosperity began to invite
closer attention from the world, it became evident that one of the enabling
factors of this economic order was the recycling of the older elements in
the national myth of racial homogeneity and familial consensuality, symbolized
by the imperial family, that were capable of eliminating opposition
and criticism and allowing claims to cultural uniqueness. These ideologies
have combined to establish a society marked by a network of tight social
relationships modeled after the patriarchal household. From the academic
world to industrial and financial organizations to political parties and government
structures, there are no relations unmarked by this patriarchal/
familial principle. It should be reiterated that the reification of this model of
social relationships was fundamentally legitimated by the machinery of neoemperorism.
While it is undeniable that this network of relationships has
resulted in guaranteeing minimal security and welfare for every Japanese
by incorporating all into a national program, this very hegemonism has also
severely inhibited the spirit of criticism and opposition within all areas of
Japanese society. This effort to make the Japanese appear as members of
the vast "middle stratum" has been reinforced immeasurably by an ideology
of cultural exceptionalism that has sought to construct a national subjectivity
devoid of class and gender divisions (Nihonjin-ron). Furthermore, it
has enabled Japanese society to resist all outside intervention and interference,
which invariably means that any view expressed or articulated by
foreigners will be dismissed as uninformed, inaccurate, and thus invalid.

The manner in which science is used in attempts to endorse more grandiose ideologies. In the realm of Nihonjinron, the work of Tsunoda (1985) —a neurophysiologist who has suggested that, due to linguistic influence, the hemispheres of the Japanese brain function in exactly the opposite manner to those of other people—has been used as evidence of Japanese uniqueness. The fact that such work is produced by scholars from top

Wallerstein also described how, in conditions of increasing globalization, culture would become the major battlefield. It is through the use of culture as an argument that individual states can make arguments in favor of protecting their own scope of agency and refuse or minimize more far-reaching forms of transnational integration.

古いですよー

欧州における右翼ポピュリズムの高揚が、ポピュリズムに関し、より具体的にはポピュリズムとソーシャルメディア（SNS）のつながりに関する研究を前進させた。日本でも、インターネットとコンピュータ・メディア・コミュニケーション（CMC）はポピュリスト運動と右傾化に関連付けられている。更に、安田（2012）、山口（2013）およびMorris-Suzuki（2015）はインターネットが「在日特権を許さない市民の会」（在特会）のような極端な民族主義的市民団体による活動の組織のために使用されているだけでなく、そのグループの基礎自体もCMCによるものだと言及し、そのグループの基礎がインターネット上で右翼的な発言をする人物、いわゆるネット右翼に関連しているとする。そこで、本稿はCMCと日本におけるポピュリズムの関係を明らかにする。

そのため、本稿はまず（ディジタル）ポピュリズムの概念的枠組みを示す。それは、ポピュリズム、SNS、そして日本との関係に関する最近の研究を検討することにより行う。次に、本稿は影響力がある政治活動家の桜井誠と彼によって動員された有権者のネット右翼に焦点を当てた事例研究を行う。ここでは、社会的アイデンティティ ・ アプローチを通じて、ネット右翼の行動を明らかにする最初の試みを提供し、さらに既存のディジタルポピュリズムの概念を再定義することを目指す。最後に、桜井誠のイデオロギーを定量的にポピュリズムに関連付けるために本稿は桜井誠のツイッター活用の部分にテキストの定量分析を行う。

本稿の結論では、まず、SNSや「2ちゃんねる」のような匿名掲示板は、日本で広く普及され、政治的目的のため、更にポピュリスト的な排外主義のイデオロギーを普遍化するための優れた環境を提供するものであるとした。そして、ネット右翼によるポピュリスト的なイデオロギーは主に在日コリアン、近隣諸国、左翼系、マスメディアに見られるような反日運動に対しての拮抗作用と関連しており、その理論に従えば、これらの実体はポピュリスト的なイデオロギーの敵として理想主義的・単一民族主義的・愛国的な日本人によって批判される。最後に、文献は桜井誠をネット右翼に関する著名人と見なしており、更に、定量分析により、桜井誠のイデオロギーが欧州におけるポピュリズムのような排外主義や反動主義のイデオロギーと多くの関連があることを実証した。

#Introduction: Online Culture Wars

On 2010-08-28 *The New York times* published an article titled "New Dissent in Japan Is Loudly Anti-Foreign", referring to a rise in politically motivated protest marches associated with a supposed Japanese "Net-Right". In the article, Martin Fackler describes this "Net-Right" (hereinafter referred to by its Japanese term *Netto-Uyoku* ネット右翼)[^2] as "a new type of ultranationalist group ... a virtual community". He goes on to state that "while these groups remain a small if noisy fringe element here, they have won growing attention as an alarming side effect of Japan’s long economic and political decline" [@fackler_new_2010-1].[^1] A small fringe element that is nevertheless noisy enough to reach print press in the United States. In its most commonly applied form the term Netto-Uyoku applies to a loosely connected, decentralized group of Internet users disseminating a form of extreme right-wing discourse online and who are active primarily on social media platforms such as *Twitter*, the anonymous messaging board *2channel* (*2-channeru* 2ちゃんねる),[^12] and streaming services such as *Youtube* and *Niconico* (ニコニコ).

Far from benign expressions of free speech limited to shadowy corners of the Internet, consequences of such outings have however very much crossed digital boundaries and materialized in disquieting, at times even violent ways. As Fackler alluded to in his *New York Times* piece, the Netto-Uyoku are often name-called in the same breath as the neo-nationalist[^9] *Action Conservative Movement* (ACM), which includes such groups as *Zaitokukai*[^8] and *Shukenkai*[^7] [@higuchi_japans_2016;@gill_nativist_2018]. Furthermore, according to a 2016 investigation by the Japanese department of Justice, a total of 1152 protest marches, xenophobic in nature and associated with the ACM, were found to be held across Japan between the period April 2012 and September 2015 [@nikaido_eng:_2016]. Makoto Sakurai, founder of the Zaitokukai and one key figure in both the ACM and Netto-Uyoku movement, has been arrested for violence associated with such protest marches, stepping down as its leader in 2014. He did however remain a prolific political commentator online, going on to form the populist right-wing Japan First Party in 2016, holding their first convention in a hotel of the equally controversial Toshio Motoya owned APA Group.

Nevertheless, nearly a decade after Fackler's publication in *The New York Times*, coverage of the Netto-Uyoku and related topics such as the ACM and Zaitokukai remains relatively scarce.[^4] Moreover, whenever the topic does reach mainstream outlets, there appears to be a tendency of framing the Netto-Uyoku as little more than a fringe movement and side-effect of economical malaise with little real-life influence @furuya_roots_2016.[^5] This is in spite of the fact that, as shown above, actions associated with this movement have had real-life consequences, not the least including the 2016 adoption of an anti-discrimination law in order to curb hate speech. Additionally, a 2017 paper on political bots in Japan even went as far as to suggest a hidden nationalist agenda of Prime Minister Abe Shinzo tied to that of the Netto-Uyoku, and viewing them as a potential "enormous online support army of Abe’s agenda" [@schafer_japans_2017], something that the author of this paper too has previously alluded to.[^14]

It goes without saying that expressions of neo-nationalist sentiment taking place largely within the confines of social media and shaped by a distinct Internet discourse are by no means limited to Japanese territory. The outcome of the United States' 2016 presidential elections, the 2016 British Brexit-referendum and the rise of neo-nationalist (that is to say, right-wing populist) ideology amongst various European political campaigns can be seen as trends of greater global political struggles. When more closely examined it will then too come to no big surprise, considering the extent it has penetrated our daily lives, that the role of the Internet and social media was of no small importance in those outcomes. Facebook came under strong public scrutiny, in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal[^46], for example, and backing the cult of amongst others personality of respective presidents Vladimir Putin, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Xi Jinping, as well as the in 2016 elected president of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte, are supposed "online troll armies". Deliberately and both on a voluntary or paid basis spreading disinformation on social media and attacking self-perceived enemies of their respective presidents, these online troll armies have on multiple instances been accredited with manipulation of political discourse online in order to influence elections, including in more recent memory the 2016 presidential elections in the United States. In the case of state-sponsored Internet propaganda, Marko Kovic defines this practice as "digital astroturfing", calling it "a form of manufactured, deceptive and strategic top-down activity on the Internet initiated by political actors that mimics bottom-up activity by autonomous individuals" [-@kovic_digital_2018, p.71].

Moreover, the *Alt-Right* (arguably the western counterparts to the Netto-Uyoku and associated primarily with the United States) have drawn much ire after a white nationalist terror attack[^29] in Charlottesville, Virginia during its Unite the Right rally, and again after little public disavowal by the President of the United States.[^24] In similar fashion and overlapping ideologically with the Alt-Right, we find associated foremost with (Western) Europe, Australia and New Zealand, the so-called *Identitarian Movement*. It should then be noted too that the perpetrator of the March 2019 terror attack in New Zealand sprinkled his manifesto with deeply ironic Internet culture rhetoric inherent to those movements.[^13] In Belgium, the mid-2019 elected politician Dries van Langenhove (aligned with populist far right party Vlaams Belang),[^31] acquired attention through his mimicry of rhetoric used by online-based far-right nationalist movements such as the Alt-Right on platforms as *Facebook* and gaming chat application *Discord*,[^25] as revealed in a 2018 documentary of notorious Identitarian youth movement *Schild & Vrienden*[^30].[^10] In France, the term *fachosphère* came to denote similar trends on the French Internet after *Le Monde* published a series of articles linking Marine Le Pen's populist far-right Front National, Online video-game community *jeuxvideo.com* and "Internet trolls" [@laurent_nordactu_2016;@audureau_les_2017].[^16] In South Korea, the populist far-right Liberty Korea Party (LKP) has been condemned for its usage of "online Internet trolls", its former chairman, presidential candidate and Youtuber Hong Joon-Pyo has seen comparisons to Donald Trump [@he-rim_firebrand_2018;@bo-gyung_youtube_2019], and the online platform *Ilbe Storage* is described as hosting the South Korean equivalent of the Japanese Netto-Uyoku [@shim_hardcore_2015]. 

If the actions of those online movements had any measurable effect on the outcome of the elections is wholly debatable, but in light of the above information, it is at the very least sensible to claim the Internet as a medium plays an undeniable role, not just in the organization of neo-nationalist movements, but in shaping elements of its discourse as well; a narrative that is by the way increasingly amplified by numerous mainstream news outlets.[^26] Furthermore, Japan's international *soft power* has without a doubt left its mark on many of those communities abroad, seeping particularly into the Alt-Right and Identitarian Movement.[^32] Former Donald Trump strategist and Breitbart News Network owner Steve Bannon, for example, was a speaker at the 2017 *Japanese Conservative Political Action Conference* (J-CPAC) and praised Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as being "Trump before Trump", while Alt-Right and Identitarian Movement associates as Richard Spencer (who coined the term Alt-Right) have praised Japan as being an exemplary *ethno-state*. Other such Alt-Right associates include for example the white supremacist author Jared Taylor (who was born in Japan and speaks fluent Japanese) and Vice Magazine co-founder and Proud Boys[^33] founder Gavin McInnes, who participated in a reenactment of the 1960 assassination of Japanese Socialist Party (JSP) chairman Inejiro Asanuma by ultra-nationalist Otoya Yamaguchi [@feuer_founder_2018].[^20] Journalist Audrea Lim, in her The New York times editorial, even goes so far to assert "yellow fever" (a sexual obsession with those of Asian descent) as a common trait amongst the Alt-Right, stating that many public figures in the movement have had documented relationships with Asian women [-@lim_opinion_2018].

This soft power influence is observable on a grass-roots level as well. [@charity_why_2016] states it is increasingly common to encounter images online of Japanese animation characters sporting political symbols ranging from neo-Nazi imagery to Trump-related iconography such as MAGA hats. The English-language anonymous messaging board *4chan* in particular,[^17] currently owned by *2channel* founder Hiroyuki Nishimura, started as a North-American copy of its Japanese equivalent *2channel*, with an intended focus on discussing Japanese pop-culture, but came under heavy scrutiny in 2014 for its association with the *Gamergate* controversy[^18] and the Alt-Right. Preliminary research on such microcosmic English-language Internet communities (such as the political discussion section of *4chan* and the conservative political section of *Reddit*)[^56] observe strong neo-nationalist rhetoric exemplary of the Alt-Right. Moreover, they argue these Internet communities to be hubs for influencing mainstream political discourse and setting "the narrative agenda for mainstream media outlets" [@hine_kek_2016; @pearson_scientists_2016; @zannettou_web_2017; @zannettou_origins_2018]. Alt-right appropriated *viral* imagery ("*memes*")[^19] such as that of a green anthropomorphic frog ("Pepe the Frog") find their roots in those communities, and have been shared in some form by members of the current White House, including Donald Trump and Donald Trump Jr. [@lee_understanding_2016; @ohlheiser_analysis_2016; @phillips_alt-right_2016]. 

Thus, to reiterate, an increase of mainstream news reports, as mentioned above, claim occidental online communities with an origin in discussing Japanese pop-culture to effectively be 1. hotbeds for right-wing radicalization, and 2. important electoral spaces for both right-wing populist political parties and for politically motivated citizen movements in the United States and Europe. Members of those movements have praised Japan as the ideal of an "ethno-state", and have themselves gained political traction outside the realm of the digital. 

This paper argues it might be useful to view these trends though a structuralist Gramscian lense, in which culture and media plays a primary role for struggles on identity and ideology. We find his logic of ideology and hegemony in particular to be a strong influence on populist

We find the Gramscian logic of ideology and hegemony in particular to be an important influence 

Based on my reading 

I propose the notion


Based on this premise, how then do the Netto-Uyoku and Japanese Internet sub-cultures fit in Japanese politics? Is there then a likelihood of radicalization amongst the Netto-Uyoku, with the offset chance of major political shifts or increases in politically-motivated violence, or is there just too great a difference between the socio-cultural context of the Netto-Uyoku and that of the Alt-Right and Identitarian Movement to even imagine such events occurring? Existing literature has thus far viewed the Netto-Uyoku in a greater debate of (trans)national identity, discrimination and of questions to what qualifies as freedom of speech [@tsuji_eng:_2008;@yasuda_eng:_2012;@morris-suzuki_beyond_2015]. Yet this author feels there is sufficient place available to discuss and hypothesize on the socio-cultural background of the Netto-Uyoku, as well as on its ideology, demography and *modus operandi*. This paper intents to read the Netto-Uyoku not as a noisy fringe element of Japanese society, but as a movement with political agency, with an ability to mobilize both on and off-line, and the power to exert influence on public discourse. Furthermore, while media-utilization is a strong trait of democratic elections worldwide, this paper argues that a shift of what could be considered top-down, mediated media (such as newspapers, radio and television) to so-called unmediated (that is, lacking of *gatekeepers*), bottom-up new media on the Internet, brings about new strategies and challenges to the political play-field. That, even in a country that since its post-war history has on a national scale, for all its intricacies, been mostly monopolized by a single party, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).

Within the context of Internet and politics, academics and journalists alike have to various degrees debated and hypothesized on the contribution of the Internet to political polarization, on the Internet's utilization by political actors applying populist strategies and antagonizing mainstream press, and on the media effects of the so-called 'new media' on its users regarding political awareness and opinion-forming (such as the effects of so-called echo chambers).[^15] Although deliberate misinformation ("fake news") is by no means a new trend either,[^11] this too has thrived due the Internet's widespread usage. The lack of moderation and the spontaneity of social network platforms facilitates the (conscious) spreading and sharing of false information (or information seen loose of its context), without reflection or without source control, and has potentially far-reaching political consequences. While this paper refrains from taking a hard technological determinist position towards the Internet (the implication being that the existence of the Internet as new medium would by itself be a lead cause for societal change),[^22] and treats the Netto-Uyoku in part as a symptom of deeper cultural malaise, it does suggest that by no means should the Internet be dismissed as merely a tool of communication that is itself shaped by societal changes; two takes that both have often been reported in respects to the Netto-Uyoku and other online-based neo-nationalist movements (**sources here**). There is a great amount of scholarship on the topic of media, ideology and politics and the debate on the extent to which media itself shapes (political) ideology will prove to be crucial in deepening our understanding of the Netto-Uyoku. 

The first chapter of this paper serves to lay common theoretical groundwork on concepts as neo-nationalism, populism, and media, while musing on the concept of public opinion and mass-media, and conciliates particular models with corresponding research by Japanese peers. The author follows @taggart_populism_2000, @laclau_populist_2005 and @mudde_oxford_2013 in their definitions of populism as a model antagonizing a homogeneous elite in contrast to "the People's Will", a homogeneous group of "ordinary people", utilizing a "us versus them" dichotomy. It then further analyzes compatibility with a so-called "Japanese model of populism" (*nihongata popyurizumu* 日本型ポピュリズム) as described by Japanese scholars such as @otake__2003, @kimura__2006, Matsutani Mitsuru [-@matsutani__2009; -@matsutani_eng:_2010], @yoshida__2011, and @kobori_populism_2013. This is important for defining our view of neo-nationalism as distinct from nationalist ideology through its application of the above-defined thin-centered populism, which the author will attempt to apply to such instances of right-wing movements on the Internet as the Alt-Right and the Netto-Uyoku.

Furthermore, as we have seen earlier, there has been a tendency of technological determinism in mainstream coverage on the topic of such online expressions, driving the argument that the Internet as a medium itself can be seen as a root cause of the neo-nationalism driving politics today. To analyze the credibility of those claims, and in an attempt to critically approach the Internet and politics, this chapter will draw on the works of media studies-pioneers Marshall McLuhan, Harrold Inis and Friedrich Kittler. Although rooted in technological determinism, McLuhan argued similarly to @azuma_ippan_2011, @tamura_niggling_2014 that the very nature of electronic media would shrink the world into a 'global village' and cause social change through increased social and political involvement and awareness. Precisely because of the general lack of gate-keepers and the dual role of the Internet-user as both consumer and producer does the the Internet as medium thus serve as perfect representation McLuhan's notion of 'global village'.[^21] This chapter will also draw from the works of @appadurai_modernity_1996, @anderson_imagined_2006 and social critics as Kitada Akihiro [-@kitada__2008;-@kitada_owaranai_2018] and @murai_net_2012.

Based on the framework put in place in the first chapter, the second chapter will first give a brief overview on the development of the Internet, both on a global scale and on its implementation in Japan. Second, in order to understand the distinct Netto-Uyoku discourse, it will in detail analyze the development of digital communities and online discourse on the Japanese Internet. While the Internet's transnational means of communication are of critical importance to \nth{21} century globalism, the Internet does not exist in a void and even its very creation is political in nature. When itself seen as a cultural artifact, the cultural background of regions as mainland China and Japan infer a different logistical implementation of the Internet when compared to the United States, giving rise to different expression of the Internet in daily life. For this part, the author will draw heavily from Japanese cultural critics as @azuma__2007; @azuma_ippan_2011 and @kitada__2008; @kitada_owaranai_2018, @kurahashi_:_2018, @matsuda_uwasa_2014, @barubora_eng:_2017.

Finally, the third chapter offers a closer look on the Netto-Uyoku and suggest a new definition of Netto-Uyoku as a loosely connected group of neo-nationalists formed in post-bubble cynicism resentment, using primarily the Internet and discourses formed on Japanese social media to disseminate ideology. 

Concretely, this paper attempts to answer such questions as:

- What is the demography of the Netto-Uyoku movement?
- How should we define Netto-Uyoku ideology, if at all present in Netto-Uyoku rhetoric?
- how do Netto-Uyoku ideologically compare to the ultra-nationalist Uyoku Dantai?
- What processes do Netto-Uyoku employ to disseminate ideology?
- What are the dynamic processes of the media platforms Netto-Uyoku utilize?
- How do Netto-uyoku compare to other online-based neo-nationalist movements? Can we speak of a distinct Japanese character compared to contemporary movements, or should we view Netto-Uyoku primarily as part of a greater trend of Internet-fueled populist neo-nationalism? Secondly, is there a common reaction to, for example, the Alt-Right and Trump-era politics?
- How does the movement organize and mobilize, both online and in real life?
- Is there possible space for furthering a Netto-Uyoku political "agenda" through influencing its international counterparts?

To achieve this, the third chapter will first conduct a discourse analysis, contrasting discourse on communities associated with Netto-Uyoku (such as 2channel and Niconico) with more mainstream platforms such as Youtube an Twitter, where we draw the bulk of our dataset. For this purpose, this paper will heavily utilize methods from the Digital Humanities and Socio-Informatic domains. Using a sentiment and frequency analysis on those platforms concerning topics closely tied to common Netto-Uyoku rhetoric (such as that targeting ethnic Koreans and Chinese, mainstream media, and the Japanese Prime Minister) might, for example, reveal certain levels of seepage and normalization of far-right thought in the mainstream discourse. Next, this chapter will take a look at the networks surrounding the ACM and the call for mobilization online. The discourse analysis will use quantitative and qualitative methods using social networking platforms or forums as Twitter and 2channel to provide the bulk of its data. Additionally, a frequency analysis of both twitter data as newspapers might also prove a growing trend of right-wing terminology originated on the Internet reaching mainstream discourse. 

This chapter will draw on previous research concerning the Netto-Uyoku, such as that by @yasuda_eng:_2012, @yasuda_:_2013, @yasuda_:_2019, @tsuji_eng:_2008, @schafer_japans_2017 and @ota_saraba_2019.

Finally, it should be mentioned that any research involving the Internet and social networks online is bound to have some risks and limitations. In this case risks and limitations involve liquidity of data, copyright laws pertaining acquiring data and lack of reliability due anonymity of the author masking intent of the original author. One issue that arose during my writing process was the effect of an on-going online *culture war* between Netto-Uyoku members and anti-hate speech movements. The latter uses methods of mass-reporting on Youtube and Twitter for automatic removal of Netto-Uyoku related accounts. I concur that limiting public access to ideological extremist material reduces chances of radicalization,[^55] but for the purposes of research it drastically impacted my ability to assess network influence and trickle-down affects of extremist rhetoric on mainstream platforms. Other issues are the extraction of online data from an ethical viewpoint and the concept of informed consent, more so in light of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The dataset contains data created independent of the researcher (or as *Doing Qualitative Research Online* author @salmons_doing_2016 puts it, an *extant* method), on platforms that are either explicitly open (Youtube, 2channel, Reddit, *matome* blogs, Twitter and *wiki*-style encyclopedias) or that is publicly accessible once logged in with a profile (public figures on Facebook, Niconico). In other words, data that is openly available to group-outsiders and explicitly intended to be so (including user-names) on online spaces that are not expected to be private spaces. With the ratification of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)[^47] on 25 May 2018, 2channel has blocked all access from EU IP addresses. All data was however legally obtained during my presence in Japan, and according to the Terms of Service of platforms I have an account on. Finally, following Janet Salmons argument for a synthesis between different traditions on research ethics, it is therefore reasonable to argue that informed consent from the researcher is not applicable in this case.

    While it goes beyond this paper's scope to hypothesize on reasons for the Alt-Right's arguable infatuation with Japan, it would, based on the context painted in this paper's introduction, at least like to suggest a necessity of researching such instances of online neo-nationalism and how to approach this supposed link with \nth{21} century populism and Internet communities. 

    I argue that unlike in the West, where the Alt-Right and Identitarian Movements have to certain success utilized the Internet for Gramascian ideological warfare, on a national level, the hegemonic ideology in Japan aligns with the right-wing movements online. In civic society online, bots, fake news and the Netto-uyoku serve to maintain the hegemonic *status quo* rather than 

    multi-disciplinary approach to CDA. Not just discourse of , but uncovering the very structure

    (I take a top down approach, from theoretical world-view to netto-uyoku as target of study)

    Emic approach (examining society in terms of those being studied) situated in a wider theoretical context (etic)?

    Netto-uyoku as both inclusiveness and exclusiveness: true japanese but also outsiders on the net, inversion of the dominant ideology. Semiotics and post-modern animalization

#Chapter Two: Media, Ideology, Populism and Japan - Connecting the Dots

In these previous pages, I've suggested that the Netto-Uyoku adhere to an ideology of right-wing populist nationalism (which I'll further refer to as neo-nationalism). I've further suggested that media and this current wave of populism sweeping the world are intrinsically linked. Finally, we can from the very meaning of the Japanese term Netto-Uyoku (the "Internet Right") draw an implied importance of the Internet and social media. These loaded statements inevitably lead to several challenges. As it is, concepts as ideology, populism and nationalism (along with such terms as freedom and democracy) are due their over-inflation in the mainstream discourse at an increasing risk of becoming neigh reduced to trending political abstractions; or to borrow from Laclau's [-@laclau_populist_2005, p.70] theorization of semiotics and political identity, empty signifiers. 

Secondly, without specifically defining these terms in a universal way applicable to a Japanese context as well (if at all possible), such loaded statements lead to the pitfall of judging an outside phenomenon by my own sets of values, rooted in my western upbringing. Populism in particular, due its renewed interest as a field of study in political science, deserves a closer look. The question remains if these concepts can be defined in a universally applicable way without succumbing to the pitfalls of sociological positivism or ahistorical structuralism.

##Discourse, Power, Ideology

"1. A system of ideas and ideals, especially one which forms the basis of economic or political theory and policy. 2. The set of beliefs characteristic of a social group or individual", thus defines the online Oxford Dictionary ideology.[^36] Although Terry Eagleton in his *Ideology: An Introduction* [-@eagleton_ideology:_1991] agrees that such a pragmatic view on the notion of ideology is common in public discourse (albeit with the possibility of an underlying critique: that of the ideologue having an an oversimplified view of the world, and through indoctrination has a distorted understanding of reality), he does warn, in light of the historical context briefly sketched below, against one "Grand Global Theory" or one single comprehensive definition of ideology; especially one that would contrast ideology with "pragmatism". After all, following Martin Heidegger's hermeneutic reasoning of interpreting reality, it would be impossible to identify and judge an occurrence without a set of preconceived values. Or following Mannheim's Paradox, analyzing a world-view as an ideology is achieved only from the vantage point of another ideology [-@eagleton_ideology:_1991: p.1, pp221-224].

Actions of the Netto-Uyoku are, intentional or not, ideologically motivated. By studying the discourse and rhetoric of the Netto-Uyoku, we can uncover the underlying ideological mechanisms of the Netto-Uyoku, and by unearthing these processes, we can then understand how its discourse is formed. Keeping in mind Mannheim's Paradox, that this paper too is ideologically predisposed,[^50] a critical reading of the Netto-Uyoku's discourse and ideological stances could help to unravel any contradictions in, and give more insight of, greater social trends facing our world today.

###Conceptualizing ideology

Conceptualization of ideology has known many approaches. Historically, the concept finds its roots in the French Revolution as a positivist attempt to develop a new scientific framework of Enlightenment ideas ('the discourse of patterns'), a form of skeptical scientific materialism [@eagleton_ideology:_1991: p.70]. Following Napoleon's attack of the French "ideologues" as, in @mudde_oxford_2013 (**Page number**)'s words, "unrealistic escapism and philosophical reverie", ideology has since gone through several shifts in meaning. From a classical Marxist view, as interpreted by @eagleton_ideology:_1991, ideology too represented a false or misleading awareness of the human situation. Ideology was however to be understood as an instrument of those in control of the means of production. That is to say, steering—whether intentional or not—the economically subservient class away from a scientific, objective reality (and hence from what is in the best interests of the dominated class) with a *false consciousness*, of one's ability to self-identify as an economic class and express a political will. Hence  maintaining the equilibrium this mode of production.[^3] In other words, classical Marx' materialist theory places ideology as a superstructure in contrast to reality within an economic, dialectic basis-superstructure relationship. The dominant ideology is tied directly to the base, the mode of production, and visa-versa. On the precondition of being universally applicable, we might then for example view the *kokutai* (国体) notion or state-Shintoism to be ideological means for morally *justifying* exploitation[^38] (perhaps viewing the *zaibatsu* conglomerate as part of a Japanese *bourgeoisie*)[^54], while in contrast during the era of the 'Economic Miracle', the ideologies of economical growth and the *nihonjinron* (日本人論) breed of ethnocentric nationalism would then function to deprive of or obscure from the subservient class the objective reality; thus maintaining or legitimizing the *status quo* of society and its economic structures of exploitation.[^37] 

This line of thinking is however economically determinist and failure of Marx' proposed collapse of capitalist society betrays in its rigid scientism: after all, despite hints of a Taisho-era democracy we cannot pinpoint an exact bourgeois revolution within the transition from feudalism to capitalism in Japan. Forward, Karl Mannheim approached ideology as dynamic and being shaped both by the unconscious assumptions guiding our lives on a *psychological* level, and by our (social group's) position within social structures, on a *social* level. This Marxist interpretation of history *itself* was an ideology. So too changed the pejorative notion of ideology; and grew the idea of a 'positive' ideology to counter class oppression [@van_dijk_politics_2006;@mudde_oxford_2013: ch.1,ch.3]. Since the early writings on ideology, and with sociological developments such as the *liguistic turn*, ideology as a concept has seen a wide range of meanings, deeply entangled with the study of discourse, culture and politics [@mudde_oxford_2013: ch.1], with contributions made by amongst others Marxist scholars Louis Althusser, Georg Lukács (*theory of reification*) and Antonio Gramsci (*theory of hegemony*), as well as Michel Foucault and members of the Frankfurt School. Contributions that have helped develop the relation between the Marxist notion of ideology and the fields of culture and communication. In his approach to ideology critique, Eagleton recapitulates top down from its most general to its most specific usage, in six points the different epistemological perspectives on ideology [@eagleton_ideology:_1991, pp.28-30; @fuchs_racism_2018, pp.158-159]. let us then observe the following list:

1. Ideology as the "the general material processes of production of ideas, beliefs, and values in social life" and "the whole complex of signifying practices and symbolic processes in a particular society" [@eagleton_ideology:_1991, p28]. In other words, a neutral, descriptive definition of ideology as *culture*.
2. Ideology as the "ideas and beliefs" of a "specific, socially significant group or class" as "a kind of collective symbolic self-expression" [@eagleton_ideology:_1991, p29]. In other words, ideology as a neutral *world-view*.
3. Ideology as the "promotion and legitimation of particular interests [...] in the face of opposing interests" and as rhetorical discourse, a "discursive field in which self-promoting social powers conflict and collide over questions central to the reproduction of social power as a whole" [@eagleton_ideology:_1991, p29]. In this definition, ideology begins to be seen in relational, conflictive terms.
4. Like 3, the "promotion and legitimation of sectoral interests" but by "a dominant social power". This perhaps in order to "*unify* a social formation in ways convenient for its rulers [...] securing the complicity of subordinated classes and groups" [@eagleton_ideology:_1991, pp29-30]. This definition refines the third definition
5. Like 4, "ideas and beliefs which help to legitimate the interests of a ruling group or class" but specifically through "distortion and dissimulation" [@eagleton_ideology:_1991, p30].
6. False or deceptive beliefs[^39] "arising not from the interests of a dominant class but from the material structure of society as a whole" [@eagleton_ideology:_1991, p30], such as Marx's theory of commodity fetishism. The economic base determines the superstructure of ideology.

###Gramsci, Lukács and Althusser

The epistemologically neutral definitions we have seen courtesy of the Oxford Dictionary fit in the first two descriptions given above, while the last three are akin the Marxist tradition; the last one in particular relating to so-called *vulgar* or economically reductionist Marxism. In these, power is a zero-sum game. The dominant possession of power invariably reduces the power of the subservient class. With that in mind, and for importance to this thesis, are the next generation of Marxists: Gramsci, Lukács and Althusser—three crucial thinkers in expanding Marxist theory on ideology. 

Building on the concept of false consciousness, Lukács theorized class consciousness as a class-bound ideology obtained through class-level self-awareness, the result of *reification*. *Reification* meaning the alienation of the self and a fragmented understanding of the totality, in wake of Marx's notion of commodity fetishism an commodification of labor [@eagleton_ideology:_1991, pp.94-99]. 

After a failed communist uprising in Italy and in order to explain the failure of Marx' conception of the inevitable proletarian revolution, Gramsci recognized culture (or cultural *soft* power) as an important factor not sufficiently taken in account for in traditional Marxist theory. Gramsci views the state as a superstructure consisting of a *political society* and a *civil society*, an *integral state* in which the latter is an essential component for maintaining consent and the former is a means to coerce and discipline those who don't consent.[^52] Furthermore, Gramsci coins the notion of *cultural hegemony*, arguing that consent to the rule of the governing class is a manufactured outcome of socialization and promulgation of ideology.[^48] More specifically, promulgation through social institutions within the public sphere of civil society: education, organized religion, the media industry, and the entertainment industry. While the civil society is in modern capitalist nations formally not under control of the political society (notwithstanding that Japan is ranked 67th in the 2019 World Press Freedom Index[^44]), they serve to impose the state's dominant set of values as "common sense": the values of the dominant class become accepted as that society in general. Predominance of the ruling class by coercion is in contrast restricted to the level of political society, which includes institutions as the government, police, judicial system and army. In a modern capitalist state however, civil society and *soft* power have grown to such an extent that this "legitimized violence" has to certain degrees answer to public consent; which again can be achieved through the dominant ideology. Yet, if contradictions in the dominant ideology are too great, the manufacturing of consent becomes unsustainable. In other words, this leads to a *hegemonic crisis*. 

For Althusser, ideology was an *unconscious*, discursive and material process; assimilated and reproduced through cultural practices in the ideological state apparatus; with little space for human agency. Gramsci does however see room for this in civil society. For Gramsci, ideology does have value. He further coins the concept of *subaltern* (a term crucial in post-colonial studies)[^40] to refer not just to those lacking in economical and political power (such as peasants and the proletariat), but those whose very cultural or social identity is on the fringes of the dominant ideology. Those whose history is overshadowed by that of the ruling class and who are denied the rights to making one's own culture and historical narratives. Yet in these fringes is an opening to develop a subaltern consciousness, a subculture. For revolution to be successful, it is therefore first necessary for those groups to dismantle the cultural hegemony by developing one's own organic ideology (a dialectic process of an "ideological struggle" with the hegemonic ideologies) unifying a 'collective will' as class-consciousness and producing a counter-hegemony. Only after ascertaining a counter-hegemonic dominance on civil society could the subservient classes succeed in coercive action over the political society [@gramsci_selections_1985: p.47, pp.210-238].[^41] Gramsci calls this *passive revolution* [@gramsci_selections_1985, pp106-120]. In the case of a crisis of hegemony as mentioned above, the dominant class has no means but to either rely on coercion through the political society, or to consolidate oppositional movements in civil society (the passive revolution).

Ideology for Gramsci is a specific historical phenomenon (a "historicist" approach in contrast to "scientific" Marxism) and observable both on a micro- and macro-scale. Ideology as a "lived, habitual social practice" on an individual level "the unconscious, inarticulate dimensions of social experience" and on a collective level that of social institutions [@eagleton_ideology:_1991, p115]. Perry Anderson[^43] builds on this. Whereas Gramsci locates cultural hegemony in civil society alone, Anderson finds hegemony in political society, "for the political form of the capitalist state is itself a vital organ of such power", and reasons that the institutions of civil society play a complementary role to hegemony [@eagleton_ideology:_1991, pp.112-113].[^42] So too does Marxist theorist Raymond Williams (Eagleton's mentor) expand on Gramsci's notion of hegemony as being dynamic, in constant need of renewal and modification, struggling for dominance and unlike ideology inseparable from struggle [@eagleton_ideology:_1991, pp.115].

Some concrete examples of this reasoning. If orthodox Marxism were to view the contradictory nature of increasing student debt in the United Stages and the ideological narratives of neo-liberal capitalism[^51] as a trigger for working class awareness and the inevitable overthrow of capitalism, then in Gramsci's interpretation, civil society would be the stage for counter-hegemonic processes in passive revolution. 2011 saw widespread resentment directed at Wall Street in the populist Occupy Wall Street, with ideological slogans as "We are the 99%" [@rehmann_bernie_2016]. In 2019, politicians Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are running on a counter-hegemonic platform to cancel student debt. Likewise, although the democratic impact of the 1994 electoral system reforms in Japan is questionable considering the near constant dominance of the Liberal Democrat Party on national politics since [@komatsu_first_2017], the 1993 Japanese general election and fall of the 1955 system[^53] could also be read through this lens. 

Although not explicitly referring to Gramsci or Marxist traditions of ideology, the language of @dower_peace_1993 in his narrative assessment of the New Left and late '60 political movements certainly seem to suggest such logic as well. As Dower states, the growth of Japan as a cultural and economical powerhouse brought to light contradictions in society—the *San Francisco System*, the ambiguous position of Okinawa and environmental issues (mercury poisoning in Minamata), to name a few—pitting "liberal and left-wing critics against the dominant conservative elites" and introducing "a more radical anti-imperialist critique to the discourse on peace and democracy.". In light of rapid economical growth, hegemonic ideologies of nationalism, capitalism, peace and democracy retained a strong grip on public consent, or as @dower_peace_1993 puts it, the "conservative hegemony-the bedrock of the 1955 System-continued to rule japan" [@dower_peace_1993, pp.5-6,p.21]. Nevertheless this counter-hegemonic shakes society in the late '60s.

>"It is estimated that between 1967 and 1970 alone, more than eighteen million Japanese took to the streets to protest the war in Vietnam and demand the reversion of Okinawa to Japan. Uncounted others were involved in the university struggles and citizens' movements against the ravages of the growth-oriented state. As elsewhere, "people's power" entered the Japanese lexicon at this time as a legitimate and essential alternative to bourgeois parliamentary politics; and, as elsewhere, the theory and practice of "people's power" ranged from peaceful protest to wanton violence. By the mid-1970s the nationwide people's movement was moribund, but it left as legacies the memory and experience of grass-roots mobilization that could be evoked in more particularistic causes thereafter." [@dower_peace_1993, p.22]

Can we then interpret this world-wide growth of neo-nationalist movements as counter-hegemonic process? 

But first, let us briefly observe the notions of neo-nationalism and populism.

This line of reasoning is in itself of course highly ideological and if any of this sounds unapologetically populist, that is no coincidence. I consider this logic an important tactic of what I call *digital populists*, populists focusing on cultural-ideological warfare on the Internet and whose rhetoric is shaped by sub-cultures online. I maintain that this Gramscian understanding of ideology and hegemony is beneficial in understanding the processes of reasoning behind populist and neo-nationalist ideology. Following his logic, the open and public nature of the Internet and social media would present an ideal public space for the under-represented to form a cultural identity and engage in ideological struggle with the hegemonic dominant ideology. The rise of online *influencers* using social media such as Youtube, Niconico, Twitter, Instagram and Facebook to spread politically inspired messages, and right-wing populists utilizing this medium to sell a narrative of revolution, certainly seem to suggest so. Furthermore, As I will expand on in the next chapter, its very creation is commonly framed as being rooted in the American libertarian counter-culture movement of the sixties, after all.

###The Frankfurt School & Post-Ideology

Frankfurt School: commodification of culture as a result of technology leads to mass produced ideologies (Cole, 2017) Cole, Nicki. 2017. “An Introduction to the Frankfurt School.” ThoughtCo. Accessed 2/27/18 from https://www.thoughtco.com/frankfurt-school-3026079

Zizek: cynical: we are aware of receiving a distorted understanding of reality and that we're being conditioned to reproduce the capitalist system

    This new kind of attitude toward commodities is what Žižek calls ‘cynical consciousness,’ or what has become known as ‘enlightened false consciousness.’ It’s no longer the naive ‘false consciousness’ of misrecognition as diagnosed by Marx, but a hipper, cooler, self-aware variety where individuals cynically recognize the nature of the often exploited labor involved in the production of commodities but still interact with them as if they didn’t know, where they “know very well what they are doing, but they do it anyways.”

    So this is the situation that Žižek finds us in. As a result, a lot of recent critical philosophy and scholarship has focused on the phenomenon of “enlightened false consciousness,” how our ironic self-awareness and detachment from our activities has created a culture or milieu of constant self-ironizing. Or as Terry Eagleton observes in his typically sharp prose, “For ideology is supposed to deceive; and in the cynical milieu of postmodernism we are all much too fly, astute and street wise to be conned for a moment by our own official rhetoric.”(3) Eagleton goes on to point out that,
collective intelligence, community, identity, culture -> lacanian

Althusser has a more interdisciplinary approach, drawing on Lacanian psycho-analysis in his understanding of ideology. Ideology is no longer a "false consciousness"

Post 1991, many commentators claim that we are living in a post-ideological age,[33] in which redemptive, all-encompassing ideologies have failed, and this view is often associated[by whom?] with Francis Fukuyama's writings on "the end of history".[34] On the other hand, Nienhueser sees research (in the field of human resource management) as ongoingly "generating ideology".[35]

    Slavoj Zizek has pointed out how the very notion of post-ideology can enable the deepest, blindest form of ideology. A sort of false consciousness or false cynicism, engaged in for the purpose of lending one's point of view the respect of being objective, pretending neutral cynicism, without truly being so. Rather than help avoiding ideology, this lapse only deepens the commitment to an existing one. Zizek calls this "a post-modernist trap"

Although this author finds some irony in an increasingly globalist nationalism adhering to anti-globalist ideologies.

    Banks and Gingrich (2006, 2) use the term neo-nationalism for the ‘re-emergence of nationalism under different global and transnational conditions’. Parliamentary neo-nationalists in Europe tend to be opposed to immigration and the EU and to argue for differentialist racism. They embrace strong leadership and cultural populism. Much –
    neo-nationalist rhetoric is sufficiently pragmatic to accept that blood-based homogeneity can never define the boundaries of the national, let alone the state, and seeks instead to generate an argument based upon historical association […] ‘cultural fundamentalism’ […] has often come to replace race in the discourse of neo-nationalists. […] [Neo-nationalism is] an essentialist and seclusive reaction against the current phase of globalization […] [that] primarily relates to ‘culture.’ (Banks and Gingrich 2006, 9, 15, 17)
    Ajanovic, Mayer and Sauer (2015, 2016)’s analysis of right-wing extremist discourses in Austria confirms the existence of a neo-racism that takes on a cultural form. In Austria such ideological discourses tend to have a strong anti-Muslim orientation. A negative difference between Austrians and Muslims is
    Immanuel Wallerstein argues that racism and sexism are necessary elements of capitalism. Racism and xenophobia are strategies in capitalism to ‘minimize the costs of production’ and to ‘minimize the costs of political disruption (hence minimize – not eliminate, because one cannot eliminate – the protests of the labour force)’ (Balibar and Wallerstein 1991, 33). Sexism invents houseworkers and asserts they are ‘not ‘working’, merely ‘keeping house’ (35). Housework is not just reproduced labour-power, but is also an ‘indirect subsidy to the employers of the wage labourers in these households’ (34). The connection of sexism and (new) racism in capitalism is that they are both anti-universalist ideologies that legitimate low- and no-wage labour and discrimination.
    Given the concepts of ideology and nationalist ideology, we can next have a short look at how the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) has made and advanced a particular form of Austrian nationalism that has turned it – measured in election results – into Europe’s most successful far-right parliamentary party.

    Nationalism is a form of political fetishism that presents a constructed national community as unitary, naturally grown, necessary, superior, and mythological by focusing on stressing a common culture, history, language, ethnicity, territory, and so on. It tries to deflect attention from how class relations and power inequalities shape society. Nationalism tries ‘through a mythology of unity and identity, to project a ‘common instinctual fate’ (uniform social status) between bourgeois and proletarianized groups, eliding the reality of social distinction in differentiated class societies’ (Woodley 2010, 17). Nationalism is an ideology that a) ‘divides the world into ‘us’ and ‘them’, ‘friends’ and ‘foes’, positing a homogeneous and fixed identity on either side and stressing the characteristics that differentiate ‘us’ from ‘them’’ (Özkirimli 2010, 208), b) makes temporal claims to an authentic connection of national citizens and their common past, as well as c) spatial claims to territory in the form of ‘the quest for a “home’’’ (Özkirimli 2010, 209).

###Populism

###Horkheimer and the Frankfurt School

(mudde as borrowing from @eagleton_ideology:_1991 p7 citing wider and narrow senses of ideology)

How then are we to understand populism? Open just about any recent article on politicians such as Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders, Viktor Orbán, Corbyn, Jair Bolsenaro or Beppe Grillo and the possibility is high any of them will have been name-called a populist, disregarding any dissimilarities in either political agenda or geographical situation. Often used in a pejorative fashion, there is however little explanation if any at all offered in those takes, and with an unprecedented soar in the frequency of usage of this term in Western discourse (a Google Trends search for populism both worldwide and in Japan over the past 10 years, as illustrated on **Figure \ref{fig:populism-gt}**,[^34] reveal a worldwide rise of public interest in populism correlating to the political shifts referred to earlier),[^35] the term populist is increasingly used interchangeable or combined with demagoguery.[^28]

#### Populism and Demagoguery

    as Max Horkheimer and Samuel Flowerman (1949) noted more than sixty-five years ago, in their introduction to the book Prophets of Deceit: ‘demagogy makes its appearance whenever a democratic society is threatened with internal destruction […] its function has always been […] to lead the masses towards goals that run counter to their basic interests’ (in Löwenthal and Guterman 1949, xi).

https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/jan/10/we-the-people-the-battle-to-define-populism

The usage of the term populism has without a doubt soared in popularity. 
Different takes on populism. What approach does this paper take: thin-centered model definition by mudde, taggart, Laclau

a homogenous 'People' (or 'heartland', as defined by Taggart), the antagonistic struggle with a homogeneous elitist 'Other', and finally the populist actor framing themselves as a defender of the 'People's Will'. Lacleau, building on Saussure and Levi-Strauss' socio-linguistic work, denotes these terms as 'empty signifiers': abstract symbols expressing universal ideas through different contexts until seen complete loose from any conceptual meaning. Whilst their theories describe populism as a "*thin-centered*" ideology, thus broadening the contextual scale of application, this chapter will first analyze compatibility with a so-called "Japanese model of populism" (*nihongata popyurizumu* 日本型ポピュリズム) as described by Japanese scholars such as @otake__2003, @kimura__2006, Matsutani Mitsuru [-@matsutani__2009@matsutani__2009; -@matsutani_eng:_2010], @yoshida__2011, and @kobori_populism_2013. Their respective research typically begin with Koizumi Jun'ichiro's television play and utilization of so-called 'wide-shows' and his utilization of television as a starting point. Although this paper's scope is limited to 'new media' and expressions of a Japanese populism, we can recognize a more recent "new wave of populism" during the early '00s, a period in time during which political reforms saw a rise of populist actors as Ishihara Shintaro and Hashimoto Toru, as well as in more recent memory Koike Yuriko's successful election as Tokyo Governor in 2016 and the Netto-Uyoku backed Party for Japanese Kokoro (*Nippon no Kokoro* 日本のこころ). 

####Three Pointers: The People, the Elite, the Will

While the normative signifier of 'the People' or 'heartland' refers to the ideal of one people or one nation, thus generalizing a group to one homogeneous whole without taking into account pluralist differences in this group, in populist ideology the 'Other' usually denotes a moral antagonist in the form of a social or economic 'elite' (usually referred to as 'the establishment'), utilizing its socio-economic 'power' to oppress these 'People'. For politicians already considered part of 'the establishment', this element of socio-economic 'power' could turn out a beneficial way to, through populist measures, blame one's lack of political success on (for example by antagonizing their banking world, or mainstream media and its press-members). Aside from the Other as an Elite, the 'new wave of right-wing populism' spreading across the world has strong tendencies of antagonizing the Other on basis of ethnic heritage: ranging from xenophobic rhetoric aimed at Muslim communities through West-Europe and the United States, to that aimed at Korean diaspora present in Japan. Finally, the 'People's Will', based on Rousseau's 'General Will' concept of direct democracy (rather than representative democracy) with a nation's people directly responsible for political decision making, takes a nativist turn as a populist trait, tilting towards authoritarianism by assuming a group's homogeneousness (Abts en Rummens 2007, 408–9). It remains important however to keep in mind that these trends of populism should not just be judged as purely anti-democratic, but just as well as a democratic corrective measure indicates groups in society who feel insufficiently represented.

As Pharr points out, however, when academic research on politics
has not ignored the media completely, it has tended to minimize the
media’s power to affect the polities in which we live. As several of the
authors in this volume indicate, the “minimal effects” model of

of American politics; little evidence has been offered of the media’s
ability to change citizens’ basic political attitudes and beliefs, and


Despite some cultural lag, there are now many theoretical options to approaching the Internet, new media, and politics. In an early stage, Rimmer and Morris-Suzuki (1999), following sociologists Kumon Shumpei and Masuda Yoneji's writings on a 'teledemocracy', take an utopian view and predicted the Internet would serve democracy by fundamentally altering its users thinking patterns and leading to a power-shift away from mass-media. Recent debate on the Internet's role in populist politics in East-Asia (Youngmi Kim 2009, Azuma Hiroki 2011, Tamura en Kobayashi 2014) have instead taken a distinct dystopian turn, employing such terms as 'the People's Will 2.0', and again arguing that due the very nature of computer-mediated communication and social media, with traits such as anonymity, filter-bubbles and so-called 'echo-chambers', the individual 'will' has been reduced to a general 'will' led by emotion rather than rationality. Thus, following this logic, Internet as an open medium for communication would become an invaluable tool for political leaders utilizing a populist narrative.

But what comfort from memories of the twentieth century?!?"

## Communication Study

USE MATSUDA HERE FOR SOURCES ON MEDIA USAGE IN JAPAN




While the Toronto School of communication theory has some detractors due its reliance on dichotomies, its members Harrold Innis (of "The Bias of Communication") and Mcluhan argue that the invention of print-media led to both a horizontal (regional) and vertical (chronological) continuity and structures redefining our cognitive senses, bringing about a literate 'space-biased' culture rather than an oral 'time-biased' one, and thus a heightened sense of individualism, capitalism and nationalism.[^23] With his idea of a 'global village', McLuhan however hypothesized that a shift towards electronic media, referring at the time primarily to radio and television, would again shift society. This time from a literate culture to a 'post-literate' visual culture that stimulates all senses and transcends time and space, thus leading individualism to a collective, homogeneous identity, in which the lack of a physical body or physical cues creates a different relation to oneself and one's surroundings. (McLuhan, 1962, p. 156, McLuhan 1967:63). Amongst other important early scholars within Media Studies stands Friedrich Kittler, generally associated with the German media theory school. Unlike McLuhan, who argues media as an extension of human senses, Kittler approaches media through his New Materialism theory and his concept of 'discourse networks', applying Foucoult's concept of power and archeology of knowledge in function of media, to allows media its own agency.

These ideas also fits well political scientist Benedict Anderson's notion of Imagined Communities, coined during his research on nationalism and the rise of nation-states. Anderson suggests that nations are not communities in a strict sense, but 'imagined' communities at best, implying that the sense of kinship felt between its members is but a social construct based on mutual experiences evolved from print capitalism and the rise of mass-media, and thus develop both a sense of imagined sameness, as well as clearly defined paradigm of 'otherness'. In a similar sense, social media on the Internet creates a perceived sense of affinity between its members and the social and interpersonal change of this 'global village', or 'imagined cyber-community' can be argued to transcends that of it's nation. In similar fashion, anthropologist @appadurai_modernity_1996 too already argued early on that the rise of the Internet as a new 'mediascape' would lead to the creation of new, transnational and asynchronous imagined communities, based on ideology rather than on national narratives, and diverting from traditional mass-media. Murai Shusuke (-@murai_net_2012, 375–76) argues however the opposite; precisely due Japanese Internet-users' monolingualism, not withstanding full global access through the Internet, any possibility of trans-nationality is severely limited. Within the anonymity of on-line bulletin boards such as 2channel, social markers remain thus primarily defined by language and nation-based ideology. (Naoki Sakai here?) @sakai_translation_1997


    Ideologies are present in politics in many ways. More concretely, I shall look for three specific ideological traits in this thesis. First, political actors construct and act upon images of friends and enemies – normative images of themselves as the right electoral choice in comparison to their enemies, which may be concrete (political competitors) or more abstract phenomena (e.g. capitalism, globalization). Certainly, such images need also explanations of why the cause of the protagonist is more important than other causes.


Edward Said:

The alternative to an exclusionary representational system for Said would be one that is “participatory and collaborative, non-coercive, rather than imposed”, yet he recognised the extreme difficulty involved in bringing about such an alternative.[14] Difficult because advances in the “electronic transfer of images” is increasing media concentration in the hands of powerful, transnational conglomerates.[

Dus: internet onder amazon, google, etc, strengthens orientalism

Furthermore, within the field of social psychology Eun-Ju Lee applies a social identity approach (focusing on deindividuation and group polarization on the internet) and argues that the lack of social signals 


## Conclusion

With the notion of the Internet as means to create a true 'global village', concerns have been raised (**by who?**) that the English-centered nature of the World Wide Web (English is the *lingua franca* of cyberspace) would lead to cultural imperialism. It is interesting then to see how relatively secluded the Japanese internetsphere and its subcultures has stayed from Western cultural hegemony, while simultaneously exerting certain influence over the English-language Internet communities.

    This also reminds me of when Derrida came to Japan in 1984 and did a talk with the leading ’80s postmodernists Asada Akira and Karatani Kojin. Karatani said something to the extent that deconstruction was “impossible” in Japan since Buddhist-influenced Japanese thought is already basically “deconstructed.”

    Derrida politely disagreed:

    “I wonder if deconstruction is truly so easy in Japan. I have my doubts about whether we can say that deconstruction is a direct element in Japanese-type thought. Certainly, Japanese often say that Buddhist thought or the Zen of Dogen was already a kind of deconstruction, but I wonder if that is so. If that were really so, then why, for example, has Asada’s book [Structure and Power] received such tremendous attention? If that phenomenon of Asada were nothing more than a repetition of deconstructive elements already found within Japanese thought, then it shouldn’t have called down such an enormous response in contemporary Japan.”

    The level of cultural power held by a digital army of radicalized, disaffected young men hasn’t gone ignored by Prime Minister Abe’s increasingly conservative administration. The Daily Beast revealed last year that Abe is a registered member of an organization called the Nippon Kaigi, or “Japan Conference.” It’s a 38,000-member religious group that believes in extremely conservative ideas — things like the racial superiority of Japanese people, the repeal of equal rights for women, a return to an absolute monarchy, and severe restrictions of freedom of speech.

    By some accounts, the Nippon Kaigi have been pretty successful, especially when it comes to free speech. Between 2015 and 2016, Japan slipped from 61st to 72nd in a global ranking of press freedom conducted by Reporters Without Borders. In February of 2016, Japan’s top TV journalists described the Abe administration’s treatment of free speech as “tantamount to a war between the political power and the media.”

    The Abe government curtails free speech, especially in the media, through strict copyright laws, libel laws, political impartiality regulations for broadcasters, and the Specially Designated Secrets Act, which allows the government to jail journalists for up to five years for working with whistleblowers.

    But Abe's administration has a new trick. Japan’s public broadcaster, NHK, revealed in 2016 that the administration is using taxpayer money to pay a firm to pose as internet trolls. The firm monitors places like 2channel, Twitter, and Facebook, and uses dummy accounts to fight with people who are critical of Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party. The firm regularly reports posts as slander, forcing tech companies to delete them. Everything being monitored is then put in a report that’s distributed to Abe’s cabinet daily.



## Narratives on the Internet and the World Wide Web

it was in 1989, a year forever etched in our cultural collective memories among other due the opening of the Berlin Wall, the Tiananmen Square protests in China and the beginning of the Heisei period in Japan, that we too saw the development of the World Wide Web, and the first Internet connections in Japan.

Internet as expression of post-modernism?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rhetoric

What the Dormouse Said: How the Sixties Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer Industry, 

    It’s easy to mistake the beta rebellion for a youthful, but otherwise undifferentiated, variation on the bad old tradition of patriarchy. Yet the phenomenon bears the unmistakable signs of a new, net-bred brand of misogyny. It exists squarely within the libertarian ethos that infused computer cultures spanning from the early, back-to-the-land, frontier hacker culture of the sixties and seventies to the Californian rebel capitalism of the dotcom neoliberalism of the nineties.

    As the same frontier sensibility that characterized early Internet culture also runs through American gun culture, it’s no great surprise that the rites of gun worship and principled geek isolation should overlap—or that they should find expression in the targeting of women whom beta men believe are dedicated to a matriarchal thwarting of male freedom and desire. But this seamless convergence of women-demonizing forces is, indeed, something new under the sun, an innovative incarnation of the free-floating male grievance that, as we’ve seen, metastasizes through culture. It’s striking, then, to note just how thoroughly both the press and the social media–centric feminist commentariat have consigned the beta rebellion to the dustbin of outmoded patriarchy—treating it as an obsolescing bug, as opposed to a distressing feature, of today’s Internet discourse.

    In her 2013 book Cybersexism, feminist journalist Laurie Penny admits that the culture of digital woman-hating does indeed have a surface affinity with geek culture, but then goes on to suggest that online misogyny is a conservative remnant of the pre-Internet past. “We have a brave new world which looks far too much like the cruel old world” and “recreates offline prejudices,” she writes.

    Academics have echoed this view, characterizing online misogyny as the politics of conservatism and patriarchy reproducing itself anachronistically in new media, or as just another emanation of hegemonic masculinity. For example, in a study of gender and age bias in online communities, Jonathan Warren, Sharon Stoerger, and Ken Kelley wrote that “many age-old forms of discrimination appear to have been preserved.” Pamela Turton-Turner analyzed “recent online hate campaigns mobilized against females,” which, she argues, are “symptomatic of a broader normalization of old-style sexism.” Adrienne Shaw agreed in an article titled “The Internet Is Full of Jerks Because the World Is Full of Jerks,” stating that “misogyny, racism, homophobia, etc. were not invented by the internet.”

## Development of the Internet in Japan

    the philosopher Slavoj Zizek noted after Sanders lost the primaries, left and right are in some sense outdated ideas. The new division in politics is those who favor the current global hegemony and those who are against it. Like the Hollywood heroes, right and left have been competing to become this new radical anti-status quo party. And so far, in both Europe and America, the right has won, implying that, as Arendt predicted, the powerlessness created by bourgeoisie systems of capitalist exploitation might once again implode into far right totalitarianism.

http://echo-news.net/en/ldp-sponsored-and-benefited-by-underground-anonymous-2channel-board

    The ニュース速報（嫌儲）community left for Reddit when 2ch changed their API to force all users to browse the site using an adware-ridden custom browser, which also collected personal information of users. However, I think many of them got bored with Reddit and went back to their own Kenmou-affiliated sites (besides the main board on 2ch, I think there are also Livedoor and mixi communities).

    But the split between the Kenmou community and the rest of 2ch goes back much further. About 10 years ago, matome (affiliate) bloggers began collating threads from News4VIP or ニュース速報（VIP）(similar to /b/, it was originally a place for spam and overall terrible threads but metamorphosed into a generalized chit-chat board about random topics). Average Japanese internet users could find out about net gossip without having to steep themselves in 2ch's unique culture (in 4chan terms: "lurk before you post").

    Because of the kind of users that News4VIPs attracted by virtue of its origins, the anonymity and captive audience inherent in large bulletin boards (GIFT, Japan-style) that allowed users to be 100% honne and abandon tatemae, as well as the culturally-ingrained racism against Chinese and Korean people in Japan, these matome blogs featured a lot of anti-Korean, anti-Zainichi vitriol spewed by VIPpers.

    As these blogs became popular, they became a vehicle for netuyo to advance far right wing causes on the Japanese internet. Furthermore, as their popularity increased, view-count ad money started becoming important, and to get more eyeballs on their posts, matome bloggers engaged in yellow journalism: they sensationalized 2ch posts, posted fake news, and practiced stealth marketing. So now there was a situation where matome bloggers were spreading netuyo crap for profit.

    This incensed the countable-on-one-hand number of left wingers on 2ch to such an extent that the staff gave them their own breaking news board, ニュース速報（嫌儲）, separate from VIPpers. This is where the term kenmou (嫌儲) comes from; it refers opposed to people opposed to the matome. 嫌 means "unpleasant" or "offensive" and 儲 is an uncommon Sino-Japanese character* that means "a store [or reserve] of saved money". In this case, it refers to the ad money accrued by matome bloggers using unscrupulous strategies such as yellow journalism. Why the character 儲 was used, and from where the reading of もう came, I have no idea.

    I've heard whispers that the kenmou community also disliked how the right wing ステマ from the matome blogs was spreading to the anime industry. Though I'm not 100% sure.

    https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%AB%8C%E5%84%B2

    As an aside, 2ch is related to Dwango, which runs a popular video sharing site, and is very, very friendly with the center-right LDP; a nephew of former PM Taro Aso is on its board of directors (and that of Kadokawa, a prolific licensor of novels and manga). Ever wonder why the '政治' category on the latter website is the Japanese equivalent of Breitbart? Now you know.

As pointed out later in this chapter, there is a clear contrast in ideology between what could be referred to as the Old Right and what we refer to as the Net Right; due the loose nature of the netto-uyoku as a community, it is rightfully difficult to speak of any ideology at all.

    Since 2012, Abe’s governments have been pushing policies that are still only on the agenda of many populists. Take the attacks on the media, for example. When Abe was appointed prime minister in 2012, he posted on Facebook that “my war with the mass media has started. I will fight my way through it together with your support.” Further, his government passed the State Secrecy Laws, one effect of which is to restrict the media’s news gathering capacity. Momii Katsuto, the former head of NHK, the public broadcaster, and a close friend of Abe, caused a stir when he said that NHK “should not deviate from the government’s position in its reporting.”

"The less connected you are, the less you have to lose, which makes it far easier to say shocking or hurtful things. Just like Trump: he doesn't care about whose feelings he hurts so long as he makes his point."

##Conclusion

#Conclusion

In my introduction, I've made the argument that the Internet has seen increasing politicization; ranging from populist usage of big-data and paid propaganda campaigns operating as *faux* grassroots activism, to microcosmic counter-culture subcultures in the West that are primarily built around the discussion of Japanese pop-culture, disrupting the public discourse on political issues. While a lack of seemingly similar culture wars in Japan could be seen as a sign that the political shift of such subcultures as that on *4chan*'s political board reflects larger social trends and leaves little space for media agency, I tend to believe culture is a feedback loop and at the very least the political rhetoric utilized in this public discourse finds its roots in the particular culture developed in those communities. Regardless, in Japan too have the Netto-Uyoku, the decentralized right-wing populist voice on the Japanese Internet, shaken to some extent public discourse on politics, and can their rhetoric be traced back to those subcultures.

In this paper's first chapter, I've defined key terminology used 

It is a pitfall to apply theory rooted in western cultural traditions without balancing the different socio-cultural contexts of the subject, and arguments too could be made against the continuous western hegemony of academia. Yet, when we follow Anderson's and McLuhan's logic on media and literacy as crucial to nationalism, and see the world as a 'global village' connected by the digital, it wouldn't be a far stretch to consider the universal nature of the concepts presented in this chapter.

While I could never claim information warfare, populist demagoguery or nationalism to be new tactics in politics, it is not far-fetched to claim this is now done to great success on the Internet; fueled by both the technological peculiarities of the Internet itself (algorithms etc) and the rhetoric formed on Internet subcultures

In the second chapter I've covered the development of Japanese Internet subcultures and the close ties of Otaku culture with the adaption of the Internet.

In the third chapter, I've found many of the ideological goals of the Netto-Uyoku to fall in line with that of the current administration, who've in turn done well in dog-whistling to the Netto-Uyoku. This could be interpreted as one reason for a lack of political success for the Netto-Uyoku-associated Makoto Sakurai and his Japan First Party.

I conclude that the Netto-Uyoku, like its counterparts across the world, is on one hand a continuation of

[^9]: Although @higuchi_japans_2016 describe the ACM and Zaitokukai as ultranationalist in nature, this paper agrees with @gill_nativist_2018 in that "‘ultra’ implies a *quantitative* increase in the degree of extremism, from ‘right’ to ‘far right’ to ‘ultra-right’". It will instead utilize the term neo-nationalism to sufficiently distinct the ACM from the ultranationalist Japanese militants collectively known as *uyoku dantai* (右翼団体, "right wing groups"). While often used in the context of mid 2010's European and North-American movements, the term neo-nationalism refers to a type of nationalism marked by right-wing populism, cultural racism, anti-globalisation and nativism, and arguably most closely describes the ACM ideologically [@dougherty_new_2016; @hirsh_why_2016]. This will be covered to greater detail in chapter one and three.

[^11]: @soll_long_2016 traces fake news in the west as a concept back to the invention of print media five centuries ago, to Gutenberg's invention of the printing press in 1439. In his essay, he recalls for example an account in 1475 of deliberate use of misinformation to persecute a Jewish community in Trent, Italy. 
[^12]: *2-channeru* 2ちゃんねる. Albeit in October 2017 renamed to 5channel (*5-channeru* 5ちゃんねる, accessible at <https://5ch.net>), this paper will for the sake of continuity with previous literature on the topic, continue to refer to this message board as *2channel*.
[^13]: During the terror attack, the perpetrator referenced an online trend concerning Swedish Youtube influencer Felix Khellberg (known by his online handler PewDiePie and as of writing subscribed to by over 95 million followers). Khellberg came under increasing scrutiny for racial remarks and has been referred to as part of a gateway to the reactionary right [@lewis_alternative_2018; @dickson_why_2019; @roose_mass_2019]. In the perpetrator's manifesto, the perpetrator describes himself as "just an ordinary White man, 28 years old" and references a white supremacy conspiracy theory popularized by Alt-Right Youtube influencer and The Rebel Media contributor Lauren Southern. This theory, known as "The Great Replacement" (not so coincidentally the title of the perpetrator's manifesto), is featured on the Identitarian Movement's homepage and has been adopted by populist right-wing figures such as Dutch politician Geert Wilters and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. It has arguably been endorsed by President of the United States Donald Trump, who has shared tweets with the hashtag "#whitegenocide" [@weiss_opinion_2018; @manjoo_opinion_2019].
[^14]: This paper expands upon the author's undergraduate thesis [@poppe_digitaal_2017], written under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Dimitri Vanoverbeke. In his undergraduate thesis, the author examined the Netto-Uyoku as potential electorate of populist politicians on both a national and regional scale.
[^15]: Reinforcement of one's ideas through repeated confrontation with opinions and news aligning with one's ideas.
[^16]:  In the second article, @laurent_nordactu_2016 describes the *fachosphère* as part of the Identitarian Movement and "une nébuleuse de sites, de comptes sur les réseaux sociaux, visant à diffuser de la « réinformation », en clair de la propagande allant dans le sens des militants qui les animent", a nebula of websites and accounts on social networks, designed to disseminate "réinformation" or in other words propaganda embracing the ideas of the activists, amongst the users of those platforms.
[^17]:  Since its launch in 2003 4chan has been commonly accredited with popularizing many aspects now common to Internet communities. The message-board has several sections devoted to Japanese pop-culture, and in 2019 claimed over 27,700,000 unique visitors per month.Of note is the self-assessed demography of its users, consisting of a a mostly millennial, male user-base from the United States and Western Europe, listing interests as "Japanese culture, anime, manga, video games, comics, technology, music, movies" [@noauthor_advertise_nodate; @ellis_4chan_2018].
[^18]: A co-ordinated and reactionary harassment campaign against women targeting sexism in video game culture and the multi-billion video game industry, the Gamergate Controversy can be interpreted as a culture war against diversification of a supposed gamer identity (a cultural identity that has traditionally been associated with men). The controversy has had widespread coverage, including condemnation by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and was extensively covered by Alt-Right key-figure Milo Yiannopoulos on the far-right website Breitbart News Network. The outcome of this campaign has been claimed to have had radicalizing effects amongst its supporters [@wofford_is_2014; @johnston_chat_2014;@morgan_analysis_2016; @martens_rally_2017].
[^20]: It should be noted that a short news-report on Youtube covering this topic, "A Lot Of White Supremacists Seem To Have An Asian Fetish (HBO)" by @vice_news_lot_2017, had as of writing, a ratio of 6,1K dislikes to 5,6K likes. The author identified a newly posted comment by "Notification Email" (barring a play-list of game-related videos an otherwise empty account) to state "absolute state of (((modern journalism))) ... the truth is people longing culture about sincerity, chivalry, family value, etc. the west is beyond saved from the sinner, hedonist, liar, and degenerate." Another comment, by the account "ShadyxFiascoX 32", had 166 likes and stated "Personally Hitler loved Japan and said they had a good culture. What the hell is (((Vice))) talking about". In both cases the triple parentheses (originated from Alt-Right discourse) implies Jewish ownership of the video's owner, Vice News. One comment, by "Ochiai's Channel" misinterprets this video's content by posting "I am Japanese, and can I consider his talk as a hate speech against us?!". His channel, with a follower count of 610 subscribers and viewed over 87K times as of writing, states both in Japanese and English *2-Channeru-nado ni katte ni rinku o iron'na tokoro ni hattari,nan nara katte ni bideo o ichibu o kiritotte riyō suru no, OKdesu! ... Tada, han'nichi no hitotachi wa, do no yōna katachideare, riyō wa okotowarishimasu.* (「２ちゃんねる等に勝手にリンクを色んな所に貼ったり、なんなら勝手にビデオを一部を切り取って利用するの、OKです！ ... ただ、反日の人達は、どのような形であれ、利用はお断りします。」) and "You can paste my videos anywhere, or you can even download it and edit to use it. ... However, if you're anti-Japan or pro-migration, you're not welcome to do any of those in any means" [@noauthor_ochiais_nodate].
[^21]: It is fitting too then that former Vice President of the United States, Al Gore, referred to the Internet in a 1994 speech for the International Telecommunication Union, as "information superhighways" that would serve as a "metaphor of democracy" and lead to a "gobal community". The text is available in full at <http://vlib.iue.it/history/internet/algorespeech.html>.
[^22]: "Determinism is a philosophical system that posits every physical event, including human cognition and action, is causally determined by an unbroken chain of past occurrences and therefore makes it possible for us to know future effects with certainty. Technological determinism claims that technology is an autonomous, "self-controlling, self-determining, self-generating, self-propelling, self-propelling, selfperpetuating and self-expanding force ... out of human control, changing under its own momentum and 'blindly' shaping society" [@chandler_act_1995, p.1]

[^5]: A conservative Nippon Foundation platform *nippon.com* English-language publication by author Furuya Tsunehiro (a cultural critic, online personality and until 2014 a frequent guest on Channel Sakurai). He claims that "disturbing as the voice of cyber-extremism may be, its influence on Japanese politics and society remains limited, and its heyday is nearing an end" [@furuya_roots_2016].
[^25]: In another note-worthy intersection with the Alt-Right, Vlaams Belang leader Tom Van Grieken hosted an event debating the UN migration compact with amongst others Steve Bannon [@gotev_vlaams_2018]. Moreover, a youth subdivision of Vlaams Belang hosted Lauren Southern (see footnote 13) as guest-speaker during another congress supervised by Van Grieken [@rennenberg_vlaams_2018]. 
[^19]: @davison_language_2012 defines a "meme" as a "a piece of culture, typically a joke, which gains influence through online transmission." (**pagenumber**)
[^24]: After the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, The term Alt-Lite occasionally came into usage to differentiate its relatively moderate members from more extremist white-nationalist Alt-Right members such as Richard Spencer. When referring to the Alt-Right in this paper, this author uses the term as an overarching umbrella term indicating both. For a closer take on the Alt-Right, the Alt-Light and the "Online culture wars", this author recommends @nagle_kill_2017.
[^26]: One Politico reporter in an in-depth take on this states "Just about everyone else, if they’re aware of these efforts at all, assumes they amounted to little more than entertainment for bored geeks and some unpleasant episodes for the targets of its often racist and sexist harassment campaigns. After all, the idea that a swarm of socially alienated trolls played a meaningful role in a multibillion-dollar presidential campaign by, among other gambits, relentlessly spreading images of a cartoon frog is at least as ridiculous as the idea that a billionaire TV entertainer could win that campaign" [@schreckinger_world_nodate] . For other mainstream news examples, see The New York Times' *How The Trolls Stole Washington* [-@hess_how_2017] and Washington Post's *We Actually Elected A Meme As President* [@ohlheiser_analysis_2016].
[^27]: A news aggregation and discussion platform. Based on combined page views and unique visitors it is, according to Alexa Internet, as of June 2019 the \nth{16} most visited global website. Within the list of social media platforms it is preceded only by Youtube, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, as well as the Chinese web portals Tencent QQ and Sohu [@noauthor_alexa_nodate]. 
[^28]: One The Huffington Post article, for example, referred to Roman politician Publius Clodius Pulcher as "the Trump of Ancient Rome, a Populist Demagogue Who Helped Bring Down the Republic" [@freeman_meet_2016].
[^29]: The Southern Poverty Law Center reports that while global "terrorist attacks dropped from about 17,000 in 2014 to about 11,000 in 2017, including a 40 percent decline in the Middle East", "the United States has seen a recent surge in terror-related violence, with 65 attacks [in 2017], up from six in 2006", with two-third "tied to racist, anti-Muslim, homophobic, anti-Semitic, fascist, anti-government or xenophobic motivations" [@morlin_study_2018].
[^30]: Translates to Shield & Friends, a reference to a period of Flemish romantic nationalism (the Battle of the Golden Spurs) and in particular the 14th century shibboleth for identifying Frenchmen based on their inability to pronounce this phrase.
[^31]:  Growing to become the second largest party in Belgium in the 2019 elections, Vlaams Belang (Flemish Interest)'s online campaign took inspiration from both the 2016 Brexit and Trump campaign, investing almost solely on social media advertisements and heavily targeting young voters aged 18 to 34 [@cerulus_inside_2019].
[^32]: Although affinity for Japan by the Far Right is of course by no means a new phenomenon. In 2010 for example, a European delegation including previous French Front National leader Jean-Marie Le Pen and Belgian Vlaams Belang associate and European Parliament member Phillip Claeys, visited the politically controversial Yasukuni Shrine reportedly on invitation by the far-right *Uyoku Dantai* issuikai [@k.c._how_2010;@phillips_bnp_2010]. 
[^33]: A far-right male-only organization driven by the white genocide conspiracy theory and notorious for inciting violence. Gavin McInnes has since gone on to write for the Canadian far-right Internet media-platform The Rebel Media.
[^34]: The search term used here was not the literal word 'populism', but populism as political concept. Both the worldwide and regional (Japanese) results therefore take in account localized translations of the search term (eg. *popyurizumu* ポピュリズム in Japanese) and include related topics. The highest value (100) represents the highest proportion of search results with all other results calculated in proportion. This graph indicates peak interest over a duration of time and contrasts interest thus on a relative scale; it does not scale Japanese results to worldwide results quantitatively.
[^35]: Although these worldwide trends reflect similar trends in Japan, they are preceded with a short massive spike of interest in both July 2011 and August 2012, suggesting the concept of populism to have penetrated the Japanese public lexicon period a fair bit earlier as on a global scale. A period, barely a year after the devastating 2011 Tōhoku earthquake in which political outsiders Shintaro Ishihara and Hashimoto Taro are making headlines, current prime minister Abe Shinzo was staging his political comeback, Tsuneo Watanabe, who was once called Japan's most powerful media baron [@onishi_shadow_2006], publishes a book warning against the dangers of populist nationalism (@watanabe_anti-populism_2012), and literary critic Azuma Hiroki gains renewed success with his publication of *ippan-ishi 2.0* (General Will 2.0, 一般意志2.0).
[^36]: <https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/ideology>
[^37]: "The term ideology, which had originally indicated a new science, became a condescending catch-word that served to demarcate political enemies. Ideology and ideologue began to connote the unwarranted interference of philosophical theory in political practices"[ @mudde_oxford_2013, p:19]. These shifts are still on-going in today's political discourse and the term is often used in a dichotomous relationship to the truth or to a "moderate position" such as pragmatism. One recent piece by the USA political think tank Niskanen Center, for example, uses the terms ideologues and extremists interchangeably [@niskanen_center_if_2019], while a 2016 Business Insider article paraphrases Barack Obama as calling Donald Trump pragmatic rather than ideological, "someone who is stringently tied to a political philosophy" [@darcy_obama_2016] and Donald Trump, at the 73rd Session of the United Nations General Assembly, announced his rejectal of the "ideology Of globalism" [@schwartz_trump_2018]. 
[^38]: Ironically, this fits well to the Alt-Right and Netto-Uyoku-appropriated conspiracy theories of "red-pilling" and "waking up" (*kakusei* 覚醒 or *mesameru* 目覚める, a concept Furuya Tsunehiro calls a matrix-historical viewpoint, *matorikksu-shikan* 「マトリックス史観」). This is a reference to the main character of 1999 science fiction film The Matrix who, after consuming a red pill, wakes up to reality, realizing humanity is being used as enslaved sources of energy for empowering a large machine. The idea is that someone who is red-pilled becomes aware of a Marxist left-wing elite utilizing their cultural hegemony over media to brainwash and exploit the ordinary people into believing a fabricated world-view. This very notion is of course unapologetic Marxist in nature. 
[^39]: These include statements that are not false *persé* but just as well  (EXTEND ON THIS PART)
[^40]: In post-colonial theory, the concept of the subaltern refers to those in the margins of colonial society, lacking of agency and being forced to resort to speak the colonial oppressor's language. Crucial early works on the topic include Edward Said's *Orientalism* (1978) and Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak's deconstructive essay *Can the Subaltern Speak?* (1983), which criticizes the practice of interpreting the Other through western methodology. Something I feel I am guilty of, writing this very paper on Japanese *digital nationalism* using mostly western traditions of academic theory and methodology as universally applicable. I find some irony too in basing my Japanese resume on my English manuscript, neither of which are my native languages.
[^41]: These concepts have been translated as *War of Position* and *War of Maneuver* [ @buttigieg_gramsci_1995;@gramsci_selections_1985: p.46]. It must be noted that this part of Gramsci's reasoning has since gained renewed popularity and seen appropriation by both Identitarian movements and the Alt-Right. Social institutions education and the mass media are seen as platforms for manufacturing consent to a hegemonic left-wing or globalist ideology, and the notion of Gramsci's counter-hegemony is re-framed as *metapolitics* [@stein_jeff_2018]. Belgian populist right-wing party member Dries Van Langenhove claims his Identitarian youth movement Schild & Vrienden to function as a vehicle of metapolitics [@nws_van_2018], and previous Vlaams Belang leader Filip de Winter added that "The methodology Gramsci promoted is the right one" ("De methodiek die Gramsci aanprees, is de juiste") [@ceulaer_6_2016].
[^42]: In this paper's introduction, I've noted the Alt-Right's infatuation with Japan in particular. Asking why, one might look at war-time relations between the far-right in the West and Japan. In Fukushima's mount Iimori, for example, I examined both an archaeological column of Pompeii, donated by Italian fascist leader Mussolini, and a 1930's German donation in the form of a black granite plate with an Iron Cross–as form of praise for the *bushido*-related war-time propagandistic media-event of the White Tiger Company military unit (*Byakkotai*, 白虎隊), the story of 19 teenagers that committed ritual suicide after mistakenly believing their castle to be fallen during the Bosshin War. Perhaps in more recent memory, one other answer could be found in a dialectic processes of cultural hegemony between Japan and the West. With the widespread 80's narratives of Japan as economical powerhouse and the growing cultural *soft* power of Cool Japan, many a page were written on the *Japanese model* (I think for example of Chalmers 1982 *MITI and the Japanese Miracle*), and thus a window opened to sell Japan's hegemonic ideology of *nihonjin* 日本人論 style of (ethno-)nationalism to the West. 
[^43]: Brother of Benedict Anderson, who gained fame with his notion of socially constructed "imagined communities" [-@anderson_imagined_2006].
[^44]: Far below Belgium (9), the United Kingdom (33) South Korea (41) and the United States (48). This ranking is based on among others restrictions of journalism in official press rooms (see concept of the "reporters club", the 記者クラブ *kisha kurabu*), strict policies against whistle blowers, and an increasingly hostile public climate towards public media [@noauthor_japan_2019].




[^45]: In its tonal shifts, structural composition and fractured nature, I feel like there is something inexplicit and unintentionally post-modern about this thesis as well. Postmodern-influenced academic literature could be a fun topic.



[^46]: In which it came to light that illicitly obtained personal data of up to 87 million *Facebook* users were used for political advertising and data-analysis in favor of Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign and the British Leave.EU campaign. The company has been involved with other international political campaigns, and was backed by the conservative computer scientist Robert Mercer, an important financial contributor to Breitbart News [@kang_facebook_2018;@rosenberg_how_2019].

[^48]: Although not from a Marxist school of thought, these topics have also been explored by Walter Lippman in his seminal work *Public Opinion* (1922) and Edward Samuel Herman and Noam Chompsky's work on propaganda (in other words, an ideological form of communication to gain consent) in mass media, *Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media*, building on Gramsci and Althusser).
[^49]: Of semi-related note, Buttigieg's son Pete Buttigieg is an American politician running for the Democratic Party in the 2020 United States presidential election as the first openly LGBT presidential candidate.
[^50]: The very fact that I'm applying Marxist critical theory betrays my ideological bias, after all. I cannot claim objective neutrality as there is no such thing.
[^51]: "In reality, it is a material political and ideological formation that has the function of managing the new mode of production of a transnational High-Tech Capitalism" [@rehmann_bernie_2016].
[^52]: These are concepts by the way that Althusser has also systematized as the *ideological state apparatus* and *repressive state apparatus*. 
[^53]: *55-nen taisei* (55年体制). An electoral system of Single Non-transferable Vote  in which the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) held political dominance over the Japan Socialist Party (JSP).
[^54]: In *The Japanese Economy* however, @flath_japanese_2005 refers to the zaibatsu as "at best a kind of *petite bourgeoisie* [-@flath_japanese_2005, p.75]. @miwa_fable_2010 in polemic fashion dismisses the *Keiretsu* and *Zaibatsu* (industrial and financial business conglomerates) in its entirety as fictional scapegoats of "Marxist scholars in post-war Japan" and "populists journalists" [@miwa_fable_2010, p52]. He further argues a historical growing demand for literature on Japanese economics and a lack of Japanese-literate Western economics who have resorted to accounts by academics from other disciplines, perpetuating conventional Japan-centric claims on *main bank systems* and *industrial policy* [@miwa_fable_2010, pp.54-57].





[^56]: On 26/07/2019 A *New York Times* article on this community, The_Donald, reports that the forum has been "quarantined" (meaning that its content is not accessible by accident and that no revenue will be generated through ads) after repeated incitement to violence; increasingly towards police officers, public officials [@chokshi_reddit_2019].
[^55]: Widespread social media platforms as Youtube, Facebook and Twitter are already making efforts to remove contents that is deemed hateful or contains "bigoted ideologies". Trump has criticized this move as being biased against conservative users[@stack_trump_2019;@roose_youtube_2019]

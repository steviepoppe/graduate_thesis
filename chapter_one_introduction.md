#Chapter 1: The Alt-Right, Netto-Uyoku, Online Culture Wars—What's in a Name?

On 2010-08-28 *The New York times* published an article titled "New Dissent in Japan Is Loudly Anti-Foreign", referring to a rise in politically motivated protest marches associated with a supposed Japanese "Net-Right". In his article, Martin Fackler describes this "Net-Right" (hereinafter referred to by its Japanese term *Netto-Uyoku* ネット右翼)[^2] as "a new type of ultranationalist group ... a virtual community". He goes on to state that "while these groups remain a small if noisy fringe element here, they have won growing attention as an alarming side effect of Japan’s long economic and political decline" [@fackler_new_2010-1].[^1] A small fringe element that is nevertheless noisy enough to reach print press in the United States. In its most commonly applied form the term Netto-Uyoku applies to a loosely connected, decentralized group of Internet users disseminating a form of extreme right-wing discourse online and who are active primarily on social media platforms such as *Twitter*, the anonymous messaging board *2channel* (*2-channeru* 2ちゃんねる),[^12] and streaming services such as *Youtube* and *Niconico* (ニコニコ).

Far from benign expressions of free speech limited to shadowy corners of the Internet, consequences of such outings have however very much crossed digital boundaries and materialized in disquieting, at times even violent ways. As Fackler alluded to in his *New York Times* piece, the Netto-Uyoku are often name-called in the same breath as the neo-nationalist[^9] *Action Conservative Movement* (ACM), which includes such groups as *Zaitokukai*[^8] and *Shukenkai*[^7] [@higuchi_japans_2016;@gill_nativist_2018]. Furthermore, according to a 2016 investigation by the Japanese department of Justice, a total of 1152 protest marches, xenophobic in nature and associated with the ACM, were found to be held across Japan between the period April 2012 and September 2015 [@nikaido_eng:_2016]. Makoto Sakurai, founder of the Zaitokukai and one key figure in both the ACM and Netto-Uyoku movement, has been arrested for violence associated with such protest marches, stepping down as its leader in 2014. He did however remain a prolific political commentator online, going on to form the populist right-wing Japan First Party in 2016, holding their first convention in a hotel of the equally controversial Toshio Motoya owned APA Group.

Nevertheless, nearly a decade after Fackler's publication in *The New York Times*, coverage of the Netto-Uyoku and related topics such as the ACM and Zaitokukai remains relatively scarce.[^4] Moreover, whenever the topic does reach mainstream outlets, there appears to be a tendency of framing the Netto-Uyoku as little more than a fringe movement and side-effect of economical malaise with little real-life influence @furuya_roots_2016.[^5] This is in spite of the fact that, as shown above, actions associated with this movement have had real-life consequences, not the least including the 2016 adoption of an anti-discrimination law in order to curb hate speech. Additionally, a 2017 paper on political bots in Japan even went as far as to suggest a hidden nationalist agenda of Prime Minister Abe Shinzo tied to that of the Netto-Uyoku, and viewing them as a potential "enormous online support army of Abe’s agenda" [@schafer_japans_2017], something that the author of this paper too has previously alluded to.[^14]

It goes without saying that expressions of neo-nationalist sentiment taking place largely within the confines of social media and shaped by a distinct Internet discourse are by no means limited to Japanese territory. The outcome of the United States' 2016 presidential elections, the 2016 British Brexit-referendum and the rise of neo-nationalist (that is to say, right-wing populist) ideology amongst various European political campaigns can be seen as trends of greater global political struggles. When more closely examined it will then too come to no big surprise, considering the extent it has penetrated our daily lives, that the role of the Internet and social media was of no small importance in those outcomes. Facebook came under strong public scrutiny, in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal[^46], for example, and backing the cult of amongst others personality of respective presidents Vladimir Putin, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Xi Jinping, as well as the in 2016 elected president of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte, are supposed "online troll armies". Deliberately and both on a voluntary or paid basis spreading disinformation on social media and attacking self-perceived enemies of their respective presidents, these online troll armies have on multiple instances been accredited with manipulation of political discourse online in order to influence elections, including in more recent memory the 2016 presidential elections in the United States. In the case of state-sponsored Internet propaganda, Marko Kovic defines this practice as "digital astroturfing", calling it "a form of manufactured, deceptive and strategic top-down activity on the Internet initiated by political actors that mimics bottom-up activity by autonomous individuals" [-@kovic_digital_2018, p.71].

Moreover, the *Alt-Right* (arguably the western counterparts to the Netto-Uyoku and associated primarily with the United States) have drawn much ire after a white nationalist terror attack[^29] in Charlottesville, Virginia during its Unite the Right rally, and again after little public disavowal by the President of the United States.[^24] In similar fashion and overlapping ideologically with the Alt-Right, we find associated foremost with (Western) Europe, Australia and New Zealand, the so-called *Identitarian Movement*. It should then be noted too that the perpetrator of the March 2019 terror attack in New Zealand sprinkled his manifesto with deeply ironic Internet culture rhetoric inherent to those movements.[^13] In Belgium, the mid-2019 elected politician Dries van Langenhove (aligned with populist far right party Vlaams Belang),[^31] acquired attention through his mimicry of rhetoric used by online-based far-right nationalist movements such as the Alt-Right on platforms as *Facebook* and gaming chat application *Discord*,[^25] as revealed in a 2018 documentary of notorious Identitarian youth movement *Schild & Vrienden*[^30].[^10] In France, the term *fachosphère* came to denote similar trends on the French Internet after *Le Monde* published a series of articles linking Marine Le Pen's populist far-right Front National, Online video-game community *jeuxvideo.com* and "Internet trolls" [@laurent_nordactu_2016;@audureau_les_2017].[^16] In South Korea, the populist far-right Liberty Korea Party (LKP) has been condemned for its usage of "online Internet trolls", its former chairman, presidential candidate and Youtuber Hong Joon-Pyo has seen comparisons to Donald Trump [@he-rim_firebrand_2018;@bo-gyung_youtube_2019], and the online platform *Ilbe Storage* is described as hosting the South Korean equivalent of the Japanese Netto-Uyoku [@shim_hardcore_2015]. 

If the actions of those online movements had any measurable effect on the outcome of the elections is wholly debatable, but in light of the above information, it is at the very least sensible to claim the Internet as a medium plays an undeniable role, not just in the organization of neo-nationalist movements, but in shaping elements of its discourse as well; a narrative that is by the way increasingly amplified by numerous mainstream news outlets.[^26] Furthermore, Japan's international *soft power* has without a doubt left its mark on many of those communities abroad, seeping particularly into the Alt-Right and Identitarian Movement.[^32] Former Donald Trump strategist and Breitbart News Network owner Steve Bannon, for example, was a speaker at the 2017 *Japanese Conservative Political Action Conference* (J-CPAC) and praised Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as being "Trump before Trump", while Alt-Right and Identitarian Movement associates as Richard Spencer (who coined the term Alt-Right) have praised Japan as being an exemplary *ethno-state*. Other such Alt-Right associates include for example the white supremacist author Jared Taylor (who was born in Japan and speaks fluent Japanese) and Vice Magazine co-founder and Proud Boys[^33] founder Gavin McInnes, who participated in a reenactment of the 1960 assassination of Japanese Socialist Party (JSP) chairman Inejiro Asanuma by ultra-nationalist Otoya Yamaguchi [@feuer_founder_2018].[^20] Journalist Audrea Lim, in her The New York times editorial, even goes so far to assert "yellow fever" (a sexual obsession with those of Asian descent) as a common trait amongst the Alt-Right, stating that many public figures in the movement have had documented relationships with Asian women [-@lim_opinion_2018].

This soft power influence is observable on a grass-roots level as well. [@charity_why_2016] states it is increasingly common to encounter images online of Japanese animation characters sporting political symbols ranging from neo-Nazi imagery to Trump-related iconography such as MAGA hats. The English-language anonymous messaging board *4chan* in particular,[^17] currently owned by *2channel* founder Hiroyuki Nishimura, started as a North-American copy of its Japanese equivalent *2channel*, with an intended focus on discussing Japanese pop-culture, but came under heavy scrutiny in 2014 for its association with the *Gamergate* controversy[^18] and the Alt-Right. Preliminary research on such microcosmic English-language Internet communities (such as the political discussion section of *4chan* and the conservative political section of *Reddit*)[^56] observe strong neo-nationalist rhetoric exemplary of the Alt-Right. Moreover, they argue these Internet communities to be hubs for influencing mainstream political discourse and setting "the narrative agenda for mainstream media outlets" [@hine_kek_2016; @pearson_scientists_2016; @zannettou_web_2017; @zannettou_origins_2018]. Alt-right appropriated *viral* imagery ("*memes*")[^19] such as that of a green anthropomorphic frog ("Pepe the Frog") find their roots in those communities, and have been shared in some form by members of the current White House, including Donald Trump and Donald Trump Jr. [@lee_understanding_2016; @ohlheiser_analysis_2016; @phillips_alt-right_2016]. 

Thus, to reiterate, an increase of mainstream news reports, as mentioned above, claim occidental online communities with an origin in discussing Japanese pop-culture to effectively be 1. hotbeds for right-wing radicalization, and 2. important electoral spaces for both right-wing populist political parties and for politically motivated citizen movements in the United States and Europe. Members of those movements have praised Japan as the ideal of an "ethno-state", and have themselves gained political traction outside the realm of the digital. Moreover, in this chapter I've discussed a global trend of neo-nationalist discourse on the Internet and shown that terms as *fachosphere*, Netto-Uyoku and Alt-Right are conceived of as expressions of such phenomena. Nevertheless the *fachosphere* for example refers uniquely to the French language cyberspace in which such a discourse finds place (with the added connotation of fascism), while the Alt-Right, now as a term unquestionably grown beyond its intended use, was originally conceived of as applying to a particular ideological movement in the United States. 

As I demonstrate in the next chapter, a common factor in literature on the Netto-Uyoku is the connection with ideologically driven ACM movements like the Zaitokukai (arguably the *real* counterpoint to the original Alt-Right). The term Netto-Uyoku however, leans in meaning most closely to this phenomenon of Internet-driven right-wing populist nationalism; a phenomenon I would like to further conceptualize as the ideological movement of *cyber-nationalism* (i.e. a form of neo-nationalism centered around the peculiarities of the Internet as a medium). Although overlapping with recent conceptualizations of neo-nationalism, I feel that the *neo* aspect does not yet permit enough agency to the Internet as a medium. After all, as McLuhan famously describes, "the medium is the message" (McLuhan 1964) and, with roots in libertarian counter-movements, so too is the Internet and World Wide Web (as I will delve into in the fourth chapter) undeniably political. Although rooted in technological determinism, McLuhan argued similarly to @azuma_ippan_2011, @tamura_niggling_2014 that the very nature of electronic media would shrink the world into a 'global village' and cause social change through increased social and political involvement and awareness. Precisely because of the general lack of gate-keepers and the dual role of the Internet-user as both consumer and producer does the the Internet as medium thus serve as perfect representation McLuhan's notion of 'global village'.[^21]

In this chapter, I've also argued that is a meaningful topic to research. The space of the Internet is increasingly politicized and fertile soil for both grass-roots level Internet activism and large-scale political warfare. Within the context of Internet and politics, academics and journalists alike have to various degrees debated and hypothesized on the contribution of the Internet to political polarization, on the Internet's utilization by political actors applying populist strategies and antagonizing mainstream press, and on the media effects of the so-called 'new media' on its users regarding political awareness and opinion-forming (such as the effects of so-called echo chambers).[^15] Although deliberate misinformation ("fake news") is by no means a new trend either,[^11] this too has thrived due to the Internet's widespread usage. The lack of moderation and the spontaneity of social network platforms facilitates the (conscious) spreading and sharing of false information (or information seen loose of its context), without reflection or without source control, and has potentially far-reaching political consequences. 

Thus, while this paper refrains from taking too hard a technological determinist position towards the Internet (the implication being that the existence of the Internet as new medium would by itself be a lead cause for societal change),[^22] and treats the Netto-Uyoku in part as a symptom of deeper cultural malaise, it does suggest that by no means should the Internet be dismissed as merely a tool of communication that is itself shaped by societal changes; two takes that both have often been reported in respects to the Netto-Uyoku and other cyber-nationalist movements (**sources here**). Although the term Netto-Uyoku and its idiosyncrasies are in no doubt shaped by Japanese occurrences, as seen in the framing of more recent works I describe in the next chapter, I maintain that this phenomenon is a good starting point for conceptualizing a universally applicable notion of *cyber-nationalism*.

This paper consists of five chapters, including this introductory first chapter. The second chapter intents to built a narrative on the Netto-Uyoku through a literature review of both several seminal writings and studies, both in the English and Japanese language. As a relatively young and volatile term, 'Netto-Uyoku' has gone through shifts in meaning. Earlier works viewed the Netto-Uyoku not as an actual group with group identity, but loosely as people utilizing the Internet and engaging in aggressive, politically-driven (ultra-nationalist) rhetoric online (**Sources**). With the widespread pejorative usage of the term (in particular the abbreviation *netouyo*), those at the receiving end of this critique have had ambiguous reactions. Some denounced the term (a common thread is the normative implication that they are merely 'normal Japanese citizens' voicing the concerns of the people), while others have mockingly appropriated it (as is the case, for example, with Zaitokukai-founder Makoto Sakurai). Through the social constructionist act of naming this phenomenon, so thus arises a group identity with the discursive implication of both in-group normalization and out-group polarization. Early scholarly work referring to the Netto-Uyoku does so in a greater context debating politicians with populist tendencies (Toru Hashimoto, Shintaro Ishihara, Abe Shinzo), the revisionist organization Nippon Kaigi, or the actions of ACM-affiliated protest movements as Zaitokukai. The social platform of 2channel is however a red line throughout these works, as well as occasional references to Channel Sakurai, Niconico Doga, Youtube and Twitter. Those works have far often viewed the Netto-Uyoku in a greater debate of (trans)national identity, discrimination and of questions to what qualifies as freedom of speech [@tsuji_eng:_2008;@yasuda_eng:_2012;@yasuda_:_2013;@murai_net_2012;@morris-suzuki_beyond_2015]. State of the art literature in contrast discusses and hypothesize on the socio-cultural background of the Netto-Uyoku, as well as on its ideology, demography and *modus operandi* [@schafer_japans_2017;@kitada_owaranai_2018;@kurahashi_:_2018;@ota_saraba_2019;@yasuda_:_2019]. 

This paper then too intents to read the Netto-Uyoku not as a noisy fringe element of Japanese society, but as an ideologically driven movement with political agency, and keeping in the mind the context laid out in this chapter, the power to exert influence on public discourse. Based on this premise, several questions do come to mind. How then do the Netto-Uyoku and Japanese Internet sub-cultures fit in Japanese politics? Is there then a likelihood of radicalization amongst the Netto-Uyoku, with the offset chance of major political shifts or increases in politically-motivated violence, or is there just too great a difference between the socio-cultural context of the Netto-Uyoku and that of its equivalents worldwide to even imagine such events occurring? Are there similar trends of online culture wars on Japanese social media? I attempt to answer these in the next few chapters.

The third chapter serves to lay down a Frankfurt School inspired lens of theory through which I will read the Netto-Uyoku. In this chapter, I build a framework of cyber-nationalism based on my understanding of ideology, neo-nationalism and populism. I do this through the reasoning of thinkers associated with the Western Marxist or Frankfurt School of critical theory: György Lukács, Antonio Gramsci, Theodor W. Adorno, Walter Benjamin and Fredric Jameson—juxtaposing this with concrete historical applications leading up to the present state in which the Netto-Uyoku arises. In contextualizing populism, I follow @taggart_populism_2000, @laclau_populist_2005 and @mudde_oxford_2013 in their definitions of populism as a *thin-centered* ideology antagonizing a homogeneous elite in contrast to "the People's Will", a homogeneous group of "ordinary people", utilizing a "us versus them" dichotomy. It then further analyzes compatibility with a so-called "Japanese model of populism" (*nihongata popyurizumu* 日本型ポピュリズム) as described by Japanese scholars such as @otake__2003, @kimura__2006, Matsutani Mitsuru [-@matsutani__2009; -@matsutani_eng:_2010], @yoshida__2011, and @kobori_populism_2013. I also draw on the work of @anderson_imagined_2006 for his notion of *imagined communities* and Azuma Hiroki for his concepts of *General Will 2.0* in relation to Internet-based forms of populism, and *animalization* within the context of Lukács's *reification* [-@azuma_otaku:_2001;-@azuma_ippan_2011].

In the fourth and fifth chapter I attempt to lay bare underlying ideological structures by conducting a critical discourse analysis (CDC) of the Netto-Uyoku. I will first give a brief overview on the development of the Internet, both on a global scale and on its implementation in Japan. Next, I analyze the development of digital communities and online discourse on the Japanese Internet. While the Internet's transnational means of communication are of critical importance to \nth{21} century globalism, the Internet does not exist in a void and even its very creation is political in nature. When itself seen as a cultural artifact, the cultural background of regions as mainland China and Japan infer a different logistical implementation of the Internet when compared to the United States, giving rise to different expression of the Internet in daily life. Finally, I contrast discourse on communities associated with Netto-Uyoku (such as 2channel and Niconico) with more mainstream platforms such as Youtube and Twitter, where I draw the bulk of my dataset. Keeping in mind McLuhanian logic, I pay particular attention to the *modus operandi* of each platform as well as peculiarities of the Internet itself. Support for Japanese characters on Internet addresses (URLs) is for example relatively new, and thus are Japanese website URLs and many profile names on social made dominantly written in the Latin alphabet (in the process hinting at a technologically-determined hegemonic nature of the medium).

Finally, the fifth chapter builds on one particular event in recent Netto-Uyoku history: The Netto-Uyoku Ban Festival (*netouyo ban matsuri *ネトウヨBAN祭り). Earlier I inquired on the existence of a Japanese equivalent of online culture wars. While setting up the outline of my paper, this question answered itself. The latter uses methods of mass-reporting on Youtube and Twitter for automatic removal of Netto-Uyoku related accounts. With a quantitative approach I attempt to prove that the focus of those labeled Netto-Uyoku has (not unlike the 'Left versus Right' wars as perceived elsewhere) shifted away from the traditional targets of Korea as the cultural other. For this, I built a library of Netto-Uyoku-related keywords which I categorize according to a typology based on my definition of cyber-nationalism. 

Over the course of this paper, I attempt to answer such questions as:

- What is the demography of the Netto-Uyoku movement?
- How should we define Netto-Uyoku ideology, if at all present in Netto-Uyoku rhetoric?
- how do Netto-Uyoku ideologically compare to the ultra-nationalist Uyoku Dantai?
- What processes do Netto-Uyoku employ to disseminate ideology?
- What are the dynamic processes of the media platforms Netto-Uyoku utilize?
- How do Netto-uyoku compare to other online-based neo-nationalist movements? Can we speak of a distinct Japanese character compared to contemporary movements, or should we view Netto-Uyoku primarily as part of a greater trend of Internet-fueled populist neo-nationalism? Secondly, is there a common reaction to, for example, the Alt-Right and Trump-era politics?
- How does the movement organize and mobilize, both online and in real life?
- Is there possible space for furthering a Netto-Uyoku political "agenda" through influencing its international counterparts?

Finally, it should be mentioned that any research involving the Internet and social networks online is bound to have some risks and limitations. In this case risks and limitations involve liquidity of data, copyright laws pertaining acquiring data and lack of reliability due anonymity masking intent of the original author.[^57] As I referred to earlier, one issue that arose during my writing process was the effect of an on-going online *culture war* between Netto-Uyoku members and anti-hate speech movements. I concur that limiting public access to ideological extremist material reduces chances of radicalization,[^55] but for the purposes of research it drastically impacted my ability to assess network influence and trickle-down affects of extremist rhetoric on mainstream platforms. Other issues are the extraction of online data from an ethical viewpoint and the concept of informed consent, more so in light of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The dataset contains data created independent of the researcher (or as *Doing Qualitative Research Online* author @salmons_doing_2016 puts it, an *extant* method), on platforms that are either explicitly open (Youtube, 2channel, Reddit, *matome* blogs, Twitter and *wiki*-style encyclopedias) or that is publicly accessible once logged in with a profile (public figures on Facebook, Niconico). In other words, data that is openly available to group-outsiders and explicitly intended to be so (including user-names) on online spaces that are not expected to be private spaces. With the ratification of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)[^47] on 25 May 2018, 2channel has blocked all access from EU IP addresses. All data was however legally obtained during my presence in Japan, and according to the Terms of Service of platforms I have an account on. Finally, following Janet Salmons argument for a synthesis between different traditions on research ethics, it is therefore reasonable to argue that informed consent from the researcher is not applicable in this case.

    Emic approach (examining society in terms of those being studied) situated in a wider theoretical context (etic)?

    Netto-uyoku as both inclusiveness and exclusiveness: true japanese but also outsiders on the net, inversion of the dominant ideology. Semiotics and post-modern animalization

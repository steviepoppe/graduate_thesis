Netto Uyoku and much of the Japanese 2ch subculture is also tied to the disaffected and materially and socially challenged. It has slightly more history than the other movements abroad because they are borne out of the lost two decades, while many others are indirect results of the 2008 financial crisis.

This could be seen through the actions of right-wing populist Zaitokukai founder Makoto Sakurai mobilizing followers for real-live demonstrations against the presence of Zainichi Koreans, but also through those of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe broadcasting his December 2012 speech in front of Akihabara (already a very deliberate choice of location) on popular video platform Niconico.

##History

To demonstrate the reach the Netto-Uyoku have had, this paper's introduction briefly touched upon an English-language print article in The New York Times. It goes without saying the term has been in use since a much earlier date. The first English-language mention in mainstream media can be traced back to March. 14, 2006, when Journalist Eric Johnston wrote a piece for The Japan Times on right-wing nationalism and the Internet in Japan, "Net boards venue for faceless rightists". In his piece, Johnston associates these "faceless rightists" (who he further refers to as "Net Uyoku") with the anonymous Internet forum 2Channel, online video platform Channel Sakura and the conservative political organization Nippon Kaigi [@johnston_net_2006]. In Japan, the term first reached print press in a 2005 Mainichi Shimbun article by @sasaki_netto-uyoku_2005, a journalist with a lengthy publishing record on Japanese Internet discourse.

"Go to youtube and search "韓国人" (Korean) , you will see what is farther than "hard right wing".

many viral blogs started making money by copying and pasting 2ch. They extract only nationalist posts because it makes their blogs more controversial and lucrative. and it began affecting not only internet users, but also general people.

Anti-Korean discourse: Manga Kenkanryu, 

Projecting an anti-Japanese (hannichi) narrative on the Korean other; 
Nativism

This paper would like to suggest a new definition of netto-uyo as a loosely connected group of neo-nationalists expressing post-bubble ressentiment using primarily the Internet and discourses formed on Japanese social media to disseminate ideology. This paper further suggests that 

If this paper were to take a technological determinist view, it would suggest that the medium of Internet itself is a main catalyst for forming the backbone of a supposed netto-uyo ideology. Its antithesis would take place in social determinism: 
What's left is but to suggest

radicalizing effect: through the rabbit hole with memes
forming communities around loneliness (see zaitokukai book)

ressentiment as driver for populist politics

“slave morality”, marked by nationalism, xenophobia and fragmentation -> Nietzsche

This paper attempts an explanation of netto-uyo relying strongly on critical theory.

As pointed out later in this chapter, there is a clear contrast in ideology between what could be referred to as the Old Right and what we refer to as the Net Right; due the loose nature of the netto-uyoku as a community, it is rightfully difficult to speak of any ideology at all. I would like to suggest a typology

    Since 2012, Abe’s governments have been pushing policies that are still only on the agenda of many populists. Take the attacks on the media, for example. When Abe was appointed prime minister in 2012, he posted on Facebook that “my war with the mass media has started. I will fight my way through it together with your support.” Further, his government passed the State Secrecy Laws, one effect of which is to restrict the media’s news gathering capacity. Momii Katsuto, the former head of NHK, the public broadcaster, and a close friend of Abe, caused a stir when he said that NHK “should not deviate from the government’s position in its reporting.”

Neto uyo as an expression of post modernism:

Theoretically, this 


 "The web centipede: understanding how web communities influence each other through the lens of mainstream and alternative news sources". 

 ""We are past being a literate culture and are now a visual culture," said "
 "Through the power of Trump, a bunch of people with anime avatars have attained far more influence."

 California-based psychologist Sandy Peace, who emphasizes the value of connectedness in her practice, attributes much of this anger to alienation and anomie. "The roots of trolling behavior, particularly among young men, are complicated, but I lay much of the blame on the internet and how it stymies interaction with real people and prevents the development of real feelings," she said. "The less connected you are, the less you have to lose, which makes it far easier to say shocking or hurtful things. Just like Trump: he doesn't care about whose feelings he hurts so long as he makes his point."


 To assert that alt-right shitposters were a deciding factor in Trump's victory risks minimizing the broader cultural, societal, and media trends that influenced their influence


 Alt-Right: From 4chan to the White House

Molly Sauter, another researcher at the Berkman Klein Center and author of The Coming Swarm, a book about hacker culture and hacktivism, correctly noted that to really get a meme, you have to be versed in layers upon layers of irony and in-group thinking, and therefore even memes that seem inoffensive to casual meme tourists might be problematic.

##Conclusion






Japanese and Korean names are written in the autonomous usage, with family name preceding the given name. Macrons have been used to identify long vowels in Japanese, with the exception of well-known place names such as Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto.

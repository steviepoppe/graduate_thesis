#Chapter Three: Media, Ideology, Populism and Japan - Connecting the Dots

In these previous pages, I've suggested that the Netto-Uyoku adhere to an ideology of right-wing populist nationalism (which I'll further refer to as neo-nationalism). I've further suggested that media and this current wave of populism sweeping the world are intrinsically linked. Finally, we can from the very meaning of the Japanese term Netto-Uyoku (the 'Internet Right') draw an implied importance of the Internet and social media. These loaded statements inevitably lead to several challenges. As it is, concepts as ideology, populism and nationalism (along with such terms as freedom and democracy) are due their over-inflation in the mainstream discourse at an increasing risk of becoming neigh reduced to trending political abstractions; or to borrow from Laclau's [-@laclau_populist_2005, p.70] theorization of semiotics and political identity, empty signifiers. 

Secondly, without specifically defining these terms in a universal way applicable to a Japanese context as well (if at all possible), such loaded statements lead to the pitfall of judging an outside phenomenon by my own sets of values, rooted in my western upbringing. Populism in particular, due its renewed interest as a field of study in political science, deserves a closer look. The question remains if these concepts can be defined in a universally applicable way without succumbing to the pitfalls of sociological positivism or ahistorical structuralism.

##Discourse, Power, Ideology

"1. A system of ideas and ideals, especially one which forms the basis of economic or political theory and policy. 2. The set of beliefs characteristic of a social group or individual", thus defines the online Oxford Dictionary ideology.[^36] Although Terry Eagleton in his *Ideology: An Introduction* [-@eagleton_ideology:_1991] agrees that such a pragmatic view on the notion of ideology is common in public discourse (albeit with the possibility of an underlying critique: that of the ideologue having an an oversimplified view of the world, and through indoctrination has a distorted understanding of reality), he does warn, in light of the historical context briefly sketched below, against one "Grand Global Theory" or one single comprehensive definition of ideology; especially one that would contrast ideology with "pragmatism". After all, following Martin Heidegger's hermeneutic reasoning of interpreting reality, it would be impossible to identify and judge an occurrence without a set of preconceived values. Or following Mannheim's Paradox, analyzing a world-view as an ideology is achieved only from the vantage point of another ideology [-@eagleton_ideology:_1991: p.1, pp221-224].

Actions of the Netto-Uyoku are, intentional or not, ideologically motivated. By studying the discourse and rhetoric of the Netto-Uyoku, we can uncover the underlying ideological mechanisms of the Netto-Uyoku, and by unearthing these processes, we can then understand how its discourse is formed. Keeping in mind Mannheim's Paradox, that this paper too is ideologically predisposed,[^50] a critical reading of the Netto-Uyoku's discourse and ideological stances could help to unravel any contradictions in, and give more insight of, greater social trends facing our world today.

###Conceptualizing ideology

Conceptualization of ideology has known many approaches. Historically, the concept finds its roots in the French Revolution as a positivist attempt to develop a new scientific framework of Enlightenment ideas ('the discourse of patterns'), a form of skeptical scientific materialism [@eagleton_ideology:_1991: p.70]. Following Napoleon's attack of the French "ideologues" as, in @mudde_oxford_2013 (**Page number**)'s words, "unrealistic escapism and philosophical reverie", ideology has since gone through several shifts in meaning. From a classical Marxist view, as interpreted by @eagleton_ideology:_1991, ideology too represented a false or misleading awareness of the human situation. Ideology was however to be understood as an instrument of those in control of the means of production. That is to say, steering—whether intentional or not—the economically subservient class away from a scientific, objective reality (and hence from what is in the best interests of the dominated class) with a *false consciousness*, of one's ability to self-identify as an economic class and express a political will. Hence  maintaining the equilibrium this mode of production.[^3] In other words, classical Marx' materialist theory places ideology as a superstructure in contrast to reality within an economic, dialectic basis-superstructure relationship. The dominant ideology is tied directly to the base, the mode of production, and visa-versa. On the precondition of being universally applicable, we might then for example view the *kokutai* (国体) notion or state-Shintoism to be ideological means for morally *justifying* exploitation[^38] (perhaps viewing the *zaibatsu* conglomerate as part of a Japanese *bourgeoisie*)[^54], while in contrast during the era of the 'Economic Miracle', the ideologies of economical growth and the *nihonjinron* (日本人論) breed of ethnocentric nationalism would then function to deprive of or obscure from the subservient class the objective reality; thus maintaining or legitimizing the *status quo* of society and its economic structures of exploitation.[^37] 

This line of thinking is however economically determinist and failure of Marx' proposed collapse of capitalist society betrays in its rigid scientism: after all, despite hints of a Taisho-era democracy we cannot pinpoint an exact bourgeois revolution within the transition from feudalism to capitalism in Japan. Forward, Karl Mannheim approached ideology as dynamic and being shaped both by the unconscious assumptions guiding our lives on a *psychological* level, and by our (social group's) position within social structures, on a *social* level. This Marxist interpretation of history *itself* was an ideology. So too changed the pejorative notion of ideology; and grew the idea of a 'positive' ideology to counter class oppression [@van_dijk_politics_2006;@mudde_oxford_2013: ch.1,ch.3]. Since the early writings on ideology, and with sociological developments such as the *liguistic turn*, ideology as a concept has seen a wide range of meanings, deeply entangled with the study of discourse, culture and politics [@mudde_oxford_2013: ch.1], with contributions made by amongst others Marxist scholars Louis Althusser, Georg Lukács (*theory of reification*) and Antonio Gramsci (*theory of hegemony*), as well as Michel Foucault and members of the Frankfurt School. Contributions that have helped develop the relation between the Marxist notion of ideology and the fields of culture and communication. In his approach to ideology critique, Eagleton recapitulates top down from its most general to its most specific usage, in six points the different epistemological perspectives on ideology [@eagleton_ideology:_1991, pp.28-30; @fuchs_racism_2018, pp.158-159]. let us then observe the following list:

1. Ideology as the "the general material processes of production of ideas, beliefs, and values in social life" and "the whole complex of signifying practices and symbolic processes in a particular society" [@eagleton_ideology:_1991, p28]. In other words, a neutral, descriptive definition of ideology as *culture*.
2. Ideology as the "ideas and beliefs" of a "specific, socially significant group or class" as "a kind of collective symbolic self-expression" [@eagleton_ideology:_1991, p29]. In other words, ideology as a neutral *world-view*.
3. Ideology as the "promotion and legitimation of particular interests [...] in the face of opposing interests" and as rhetorical discourse, a "discursive field in which self-promoting social powers conflict and collide over questions central to the reproduction of social power as a whole" [@eagleton_ideology:_1991, p29]. In this definition, ideology begins to be seen in relational, conflictive terms.
4. Like 3, the "promotion and legitimation of sectoral interests" but by "a dominant social power". This perhaps in order to "*unify* a social formation in ways convenient for its rulers [...] securing the complicity of subordinated classes and groups" [@eagleton_ideology:_1991, pp29-30]. This definition refines the third definition
5. Like 4, "ideas and beliefs which help to legitimate the interests of a ruling group or class" but specifically through "distortion and dissimulation" [@eagleton_ideology:_1991, p30].
6. False or deceptive beliefs[^39] "arising not from the interests of a dominant class but from the material structure of society as a whole" [@eagleton_ideology:_1991, p30], such as Marx's theory of commodity fetishism. The economic base determines the superstructure of ideology.

###Gramsci, Lukács and Althusser

The epistemologically neutral definitions we have seen courtesy of the Oxford Dictionary fit in the first two descriptions given above, while the last three are akin the Marxist tradition; the last one in particular relating to so-called *vulgar* or economically reductionist Marxism. In these, power is a zero-sum game. The dominant possession of power invariably reduces the power of the subservient class. With that in mind, and for importance to this thesis, are the next generation of Marxists: Gramsci, Lukács and Althusser—three crucial thinkers in expanding Marxist theory on ideology. 

Building on the concept of false consciousness, Lukács theorized class consciousness as a class-bound ideology obtained through class-level self-awareness, the result of *reification*. *Reification* meaning the alienation of the self and a fragmented understanding of the totality, in wake of Marx's notion of commodity fetishism an commodification of labor [@eagleton_ideology:_1991, pp.94-99]. 

After a failed communist uprising in Italy and in order to explain the failure of Marx' conception of the inevitable proletarian revolution, Gramsci recognized culture (or cultural *soft* power) as an important factor not sufficiently taken in account for in traditional Marxist theory. Gramsci views the state as a superstructure consisting of a *political society* and a *civil society*, an *integral state* in which the latter is an essential component for maintaining consent and the former is a means to coerce and discipline those who don't consent.[^52] Furthermore, Gramsci coins the notion of *cultural hegemony*, arguing that consent to the rule of the governing class is a manufactured outcome of socialization and promulgation of ideology.[^48] More specifically, promulgation through social institutions within the public sphere of civil society: education, organized religion, the media industry, and the entertainment industry. While the civil society is in modern capitalist nations formally not under control of the political society (notwithstanding that Japan is ranked 67th in the 2019 World Press Freedom Index[^44]), they serve to impose the state's dominant set of values as "common sense": the values of the dominant class become accepted as that society in general. Predominance of the ruling class by coercion is in contrast restricted to the level of political society, which includes institutions as the government, police, judicial system and army. In a modern capitalist state however, civil society and *soft* power have grown to such an extent that this "legitimized violence" has to certain degrees answer to public consent; which again can be achieved through the dominant ideology. Yet, if contradictions in the dominant ideology are too great, the manufacturing of consent becomes unsustainable. In other words, this leads to a *hegemonic crisis*. 

For Althusser, ideology was an *unconscious*, discursive and material process; assimilated and reproduced through cultural practices in the ideological state apparatus; with little space for human agency. Gramsci does however see room for this in civil society. For Gramsci, ideology does have value. He further coins the concept of *subaltern* (a term crucial in post-colonial studies)[^40] to refer not just to those lacking in economical and political power (such as peasants and the proletariat), but those whose very cultural or social identity is on the fringes of the dominant ideology. Those whose history is overshadowed by that of the ruling class and who are denied the rights to making one's own culture and historical narratives. Yet in these fringes is an opening to develop a subaltern consciousness, a subculture. For revolution to be successful, it is therefore first necessary for those groups to dismantle the cultural hegemony by developing one's own organic ideology (a dialectic process of an "ideological struggle" with the hegemonic ideologies) unifying a 'collective will' as class-consciousness and producing a counter-hegemony. Only after ascertaining a counter-hegemonic dominance on civil society could the subservient classes succeed in coercive action over the political society [@gramsci_selections_1985: p.47, pp.210-238].[^41] Gramsci calls this *passive revolution* [@gramsci_selections_1985, pp106-120]. In the case of a crisis of hegemony as mentioned above, the dominant class has no means but to either rely on coercion through the political society, or to consolidate oppositional movements in civil society (the passive revolution).

Ideology for Gramsci is a specific historical phenomenon (a "historicist" approach in contrast to "scientific" Marxism) and observable both on a micro- and macro-scale. Ideology as a "lived, habitual social practice" on an individual level "the unconscious, inarticulate dimensions of social experience" and on a collective level that of social institutions [@eagleton_ideology:_1991, p115]. Perry Anderson[^43] builds on this. Whereas Gramsci locates cultural hegemony in civil society alone, Anderson finds hegemony in political society, "for the political form of the capitalist state is itself a vital organ of such power", and reasons that the institutions of civil society play a complementary role to hegemony [@eagleton_ideology:_1991, pp.112-113].[^42] So too does Marxist theorist Raymond Williams (Eagleton's mentor) expand on Gramsci's notion of hegemony as being dynamic, in constant need of renewal and modification, struggling for dominance and unlike ideology inseparable from struggle [@eagleton_ideology:_1991, pp.115].

Some concrete examples of this reasoning. If orthodox Marxism were to view the contradictory nature of increasing student debt in the United Stages and the ideological narratives of neo-liberal capitalism[^51] as a trigger for working class awareness and the inevitable overthrow of capitalism, then in Gramsci's interpretation, civil society would be the stage for counter-hegemonic processes in passive revolution. 2011 saw widespread resentment directed at Wall Street in the populist Occupy Wall Street, with ideological slogans as "We are the 99%" [@rehmann_bernie_2016]. In 2019, politicians Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are running on a counter-hegemonic platform to cancel student debt. Likewise, although the democratic impact of the 1994 electoral system reforms in Japan is questionable considering the near constant dominance of the Liberal Democrat Party on national politics since [@komatsu_first_2017], the 1993 Japanese general election and fall of the 1955 system[^53] could also be read through this lens. 

When Japan, as elsewhere, entered a late-capitalist phase of mass consumerism, different contradictions arose. Although not explicitly referring to Gramsci or Marxist traditions of ideology, the language of @dower_peace_1993 in his narrative assessment of the New Left and late '60 political movements certainly seem to suggest such logic as well. As Dower states, the growth of Japan as a cultural and economical powerhouse brought to light contradictions in society—the *San Francisco System*, the ambiguous position of Okinawa and environmental issues (mercury poisoning in Minamata), to name a few—pitting "liberal and left-wing critics against the dominant conservative elites" and introducing "a more radical anti-imperialist critique to the discourse on peace and democracy.". In light of rapid economical growth, hegemonic ideologies of nationalism, capitalism, peace and democracy retained a strong grip on public consent, or as @dower_peace_1993 puts it, the "conservative hegemony-the bedrock of the 1955 System-continued to rule japan" [@dower_peace_1993, pp.5-6,p.21]. Nevertheless this counter-hegemonic shakes society in the late '60s.

>"It is estimated that between 1967 and 1970 alone, more than eighteen million Japanese took to the streets to protest the war in Vietnam and demand the reversion of Okinawa to Japan. Uncounted others were involved in the university struggles and citizens' movements against the ravages of the growth-oriented state. As elsewhere, "people's power" entered the Japanese lexicon at this time as a legitimate and essential alternative to bourgeois parliamentary politics; and, as elsewhere, the theory and practice of "people's power" ranged from peaceful protest to wanton violence. By the mid-1970s the nationwide people's movement was moribund, but it left as legacies the memory and experience of grass-roots mobilization that could be evoked in more particularistic causes thereafter." [@dower_peace_1993, p.22]

This was a period of hegemonic crisis, but one that in its aftermath did leave a considerably sour aftertaste in the mouths of many. Communists groups associated with New Left thought, such as the Red Army, proceeded directly to direct action and vise-versa so did the political society too respond with violence. Furthermore, in light of economic growth and relative public wealth, the hegemonic ideologies of economic and ethnic nationalism (what @dower_peace_1993 coins a "late-Showa cult of exceptionalism" [-@dower_peace_1993, p.6]) had despite high profile political scandals as the Lockheed bribery thus far helped retain a strong, manufactured grip on consent. Nevertheless, with the collapse of the bubble economy so too did contradictions in the dominant, hegemonic ideology once again become unearthed (Akio Morita and Shintaro Ishihara's 1989 essay *The Japan That Can Say No* has not aged particularly well), renewing distrust in established politics and the political system behind it. In other words, the political reform of the 1955 System by temporarily allied political outsiders in 1994 was the logical outcome of an increased alienated Japanese civil society. 


This line of reasoning is in itself of course highly ideological and if any of this sounds unapologetically populist, that is no coincidence. I consider this logic an important tactic of what I call *digital populists*, populists focusing on cultural-ideological warfare on the Internet and whose rhetoric is shaped by sub-cultures online. I maintain that this Gramscian understanding of ideology and hegemony is beneficial in understanding the processes of reasoning behind populist, neo-nationalist (and ultimately, 'cyber-nationalist') ideology. Following his logic, the open and public nature of the Internet and social media would present an ideal public space for the under-represented to form a cultural identity and engage in ideological struggle with the hegemonic dominant ideology. The rise of online *influencers* using social media such as Youtube, Niconico, Twitter, Instagram and Facebook to spread politically inspired messages, and right-wing populists utilizing this medium to sell a narrative of revolution, certainly seem to suggest so. Furthermore, As I will expand on in the next chapter, its very creation is commonly framed as being rooted in the American libertarian counter-culture movement of the sixties, after all.

###The Frankfurt School & Post-Ideology

Frankfurt School: commodification of culture as a result of technology leads to mass produced ideologies (Cole, 2017) Cole, Nicki. 2017. “An Introduction to the Frankfurt School.” ThoughtCo. Accessed 2/27/18 from https://www.thoughtco.com/frankfurt-school-3026079

Zizek: cynical: we are aware of receiving a distorted understanding of reality and that we're being conditioned to reproduce the capitalist system

    This new kind of attitude toward commodities is what Žižek calls ‘cynical consciousness,’ or what has become known as ‘enlightened false consciousness.’ It’s no longer the naive ‘false consciousness’ of misrecognition as diagnosed by Marx, but a hipper, cooler, self-aware variety where individuals cynically recognize the nature of the often exploited labor involved in the production of commodities but still interact with them as if they didn’t know, where they “know very well what they are doing, but they do it anyways.”

    So this is the situation that Žižek finds us in. As a result, a lot of recent critical philosophy and scholarship has focused on the phenomenon of “enlightened false consciousness,” how our ironic self-awareness and detachment from our activities has created a culture or milieu of constant self-ironizing. Or as Terry Eagleton observes in his typically sharp prose, “For ideology is supposed to deceive; and in the cynical milieu of postmodernism we are all much too fly, astute and street wise to be conned for a moment by our own official rhetoric.”(3) Eagleton goes on to point out that,
collective intelligence, community, identity, culture -> lacanian

Althusser has a more interdisciplinary approach, drawing on Lacanian psycho-analysis in his understanding of ideology. Ideology is no longer a "false consciousness"

Post 1991, many commentators claim that we are living in a post-ideological age,[33] in which redemptive, all-encompassing ideologies have failed, and this view is often associated[by whom?] with Francis Fukuyama's writings on "the end of history".[34] On the other hand, Nienhueser sees research (in the field of human resource management) as ongoingly "generating ideology".[35]

    Slavoj Zizek has pointed out how the very notion of post-ideology can enable the deepest, blindest form of ideology. A sort of false consciousness or false cynicism, engaged in for the purpose of lending one's point of view the respect of being objective, pretending neutral cynicism, without truly being so. Rather than help avoiding ideology, this lapse only deepens the commitment to an existing one. Zizek calls this "a post-modernist trap"

   As Van Dijk points out however, Politics is one of the social domains whose practices are virtually exclusively discursive; political cognition is by definition ideologically based; and political ideologies are largely reproduced by discourse. 

Schrijven over Discourse

Identity, Hegemony and Empty Signifiers

As @eagleton_ideology:_1991 p9 argues, ideology is a matter of discourse, and the usage of language towards specific goals, which are to be extracted from their discursivev context.

## Neo-Nationalism

(deel over ideologie als samenraapsel van verschillende elementen, referentie naar postmodernisme en simulacra btw) After all, Freeden 1996 demonstrates ideologies to not drawn from one depository for one ideology, but "from a large, shared repertoire based on a wide range of arguments with diverse origins."

In an interview with Cas Mudde, Mudde describes the ideology of the radial right as including "three features: nativism, authoritarianism, and populism." The previous pages have offered an extensive take on populism, ultimately residing with Mudde's 

https://www.vox.com/2016/5/31/11722994/european-far-right-cas-mudde

Although this author finds some irony in an increasingly globalist nationalism adhering to anti-globalist ideologies.

    Banks and Gingrich (2006, 2) use the term neo-nationalism for the ‘re-emergence of nationalism under different global and transnational conditions’. Parliamentary neo-nationalists in Europe tend to be opposed to immigration and the EU and to argue for differentialist racism. They embrace strong leadership and cultural populism. Much –
    neo-nationalist rhetoric is sufficiently pragmatic to accept that blood-based homogeneity can never define the boundaries of the national, let alone the state, and seeks instead to generate an argument based upon historical association […] ‘cultural fundamentalism’ […] has often come to replace race in the discourse of neo-nationalists. […] [Neo-nationalism is] an essentialist and seclusive reaction against the current phase of globalization […] [that] primarily relates to ‘culture.’ (Banks and Gingrich 2006, 9, 15, 17)
    Ajanovic, Mayer and Sauer (2015, 2016)’s analysis of right-wing extremist discourses in Austria confirms the existence of a neo-racism that takes on a cultural form. In Austria such ideological discourses tend to have a strong anti-Muslim orientation. A negative difference between Austrians and Muslims is
    Immanuel Wallerstein argues that racism and sexism are necessary elements of capitalism. Racism and xenophobia are strategies in capitalism to ‘minimize the costs of production’ and to ‘minimize the costs of political disruption (hence minimize – not eliminate, because one cannot eliminate – the protests of the labour force)’ (Balibar and Wallerstein 1991, 33). Sexism invents houseworkers and asserts they are ‘not ‘working’, merely ‘keeping house’ (35). Housework is not just reproduced labour-power, but is also an ‘indirect subsidy to the employers of the wage labourers in these households’ (34). The connection of sexism and (new) racism in capitalism is that they are both anti-universalist ideologies that legitimate low- and no-wage labour and discrimination.
    Given the concepts of ideology and nationalist ideology, we can next have a short look at how the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) has made and advanced a particular form of Austrian nationalism that has turned it – measured in election results – into Europe’s most successful far-right parliamentary party.

    Nationalism is a form of political fetishism that presents a constructed national community as unitary, naturally grown, necessary, superior, and mythological by focusing on stressing a common culture, history, language, ethnicity, territory, and so on. It tries to deflect attention from how class relations and power inequalities shape society. Nationalism tries ‘through a mythology of unity and identity, to project a ‘common instinctual fate’ (uniform social status) between bourgeois and proletarianized groups, eliding the reality of social distinction in differentiated class societies’ (Woodley 2010, 17). Nationalism is an ideology that a) ‘divides the world into ‘us’ and ‘them’, ‘friends’ and ‘foes’, positing a homogeneous and fixed identity on either side and stressing the characteristics that differentiate ‘us’ from ‘them’’ (Özkirimli 2010, 208), b) makes temporal claims to an authentic connection of national citizens and their common past, as well as c) spatial claims to territory in the form of ‘the quest for a “home’’’ (Özkirimli 2010, 209).

###Populism

###Horkheimer and the Frankfurt School

(mudde as borrowing from @eagleton_ideology:_1991 p7 citing wider and narrow senses of ideology)

How then are we to understand populism? Open just about any recent article on politicians such as Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders, Viktor Orbán, Corbyn, Jair Bolsenaro or Beppe Grillo and the possibility is high any of them will have been name-called a populist, disregarding any dissimilarities in either political agenda or geographical situation. Often used in a pejorative fashion, there is however little explanation if any at all offered in those takes, and with an unprecedented soar in the frequency of usage of this term in Western discourse (a Google Trends search for populism both worldwide and in Japan over the past 10 years, as illustrated on **Figure \ref{fig:populism-gt}**,[^34] reveal a worldwide rise of public interest in populism correlating to the political shifts referred to earlier),[^35] the term populist is increasingly used interchangeable or combined with demagoguery.[^28]

#### Populism and Demagoguery

    as Max Horkheimer and Samuel Flowerman (1949) noted more than sixty-five years ago, in their introduction to the book Prophets of Deceit: ‘demagogy makes its appearance whenever a democratic society is threatened with internal destruction […] its function has always been […] to lead the masses towards goals that run counter to their basic interests’ (in Löwenthal and Guterman 1949, xi).

So how does this differ from the concept of demagoguery, if at all?

Populism has increasingly come to denote right-wing populism.

The most commonly referred to framework, one which this paper will follow too, is that of Kaltwasser and Mudde.

https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/jan/10/we-the-people-the-battle-to-define-populism

The usage of the term populism has without a doubt soared in popularity. 
Different takes on populism. What approach does this paper take: thin-centered model definition by mudde, taggart, Laclau

a homogenous 'People' (or 'heartland', as defined by Taggart), the antagonistic struggle with a homogeneous elitist 'Other', and finally the populist actor framing themselves as a defender of the 'People's Will'. Lacleau, building on Saussure and Levi-Strauss' socio-linguistic work, denotes these terms as 'empty signifiers': abstract symbols expressing universal ideas through different contexts until seen complete loose from any conceptual meaning. Whilst their theories describe populism as a "*thin-centered*" ideology, thus broadening the contextual scale of application, this chapter will first analyze compatibility with a so-called "Japanese model of populism" (*nihongata popyurizumu* 日本型ポピュリズム) as described by Japanese scholars such as @otake__2003, @kimura__2006, Matsutani Mitsuru [-@matsutani__2009@matsutani__2009; -@matsutani_eng:_2010], @yoshida__2011, and @kobori_populism_2013. Their respective research typically begin with Koizumi Jun'ichiro's television play and utilization of so-called 'wide-shows' and his utilization of television as a starting point. Although this paper's scope is limited to 'new media' and expressions of a Japanese populism, we can recognize a more recent "new wave of populism" during the early '00s, a period in time during which political reforms saw a rise of populist actors as Ishihara Shintaro and Hashimoto Toru, as well as in more recent memory Koike Yuriko's successful election as Tokyo Governor in 2016 and the Netto-Uyoku backed Party for Japanese Kokoro (*Nippon no Kokoro* 日本のこころ). 

####Three Pointers: The People, the Elite, the Will

While the normative signifier of 'the People' or 'heartland' refers to the ideal of one people or one nation, thus generalizing a group to one homogeneous whole without taking into account pluralist differences in this group, in populist ideology the 'Other' usually denotes a moral antagonist in the form of a social or economic 'elite' (usually referred to as 'the establishment'), utilizing its socio-economic 'power' to oppress these 'People'. For politicians already considered part of 'the establishment', this element of socio-economic 'power' could turn out a beneficial way to, through populist measures, blame one's lack of political success on (for example by antagonizing their banking world, or mainstream media and its press-members). Aside from the Other as an Elite, the 'new wave of right-wing populism' spreading across the world has strong tendencies of antagonizing the Other on basis of ethnic heritage: ranging from xenophobic rhetoric aimed at Muslim communities through West-Europe and the United States, to that aimed at Korean diaspora present in Japan. Finally, the 'People's Will', based on Rousseau's 'General Will' concept of direct democracy (rather than representative democracy) with a nation's people directly responsible for political decision making, takes a nativist turn as a populist trait, tilting towards authoritarianism by assuming a group's homogeneousness (Abts en Rummens 2007, 408–9). It remains important however to keep in mind that these trends of populism should not just be judged as purely anti-democratic, but just as well as a democratic corrective measure indicates groups in society who feel insufficiently represented.

####Populism as self-correcting democracy?

ポピュリズムとは何か for example proposes populism as a form of self-correcting democracy, rebalancing an unfavorely tilted political system to account with disenchanted masses.

Jan Werner Muller, author of What is Populism, offers a counter-argument, analyzing patterns of authoritarian governance in regions were populists have gained sufficient political power.

One danger for democracy is the attack of 

Note that this fictional account of the People is by large a construct on the populist's terms. In other words, it is the populist that defines who belongs to this notion of the People and who should be excluded. This pattern simplifies matters: 

A zero-sum game; if one is 反日, regardless of ones Japanese passport, one cannot possibly represent the best interest of the *real* Japanese people.

##Media

Antonio Gramsci: "s a hegemonic culture using ideology rather than violence, economic force, or coercion. Hegemonic culture propagates its own values and norms so that they become the "common sense" values of all and thus maintain the status quo. Hegemonic power is therefore used to maintain consent to the capitalist order, rather than coercive power using force to maintain order. This cultural hegemony is produced and reproduced by the dominant class through the institutions that form the superstructure."

P371 Susan J Pharr Media and Politics in Japan

ARGUMENT dat media door informal decision making niet plural wordt, tov internet

As Pharr points out, however, when academic research on politics
has not ignored the media completely, it has tended to minimize the
media’s power to affect the polities in which we live. As several of the
authors in this volume indicate, the “minimal effects” model of
media such as television has been particularly dominant in the study
of American politics; little evidence has been offered of the media’s
ability to change citizens’ basic political attitudes and beliefs, and


Despite some cultural lag, there are now many theoretical options to approaching the Internet, new media, and politics. In an early stage, Rimmer and Morris-Suzuki (1999), following sociologists Kumon Shumpei and Masuda Yoneji's writings on a 'teledemocracy', take an utopian view and predicted the Internet would serve democracy by fundamentally altering its users thinking patterns and leading to a power-shift away from mass-media. Recent debate on the Internet's role in populist politics in East-Asia (Youngmi Kim 2009, Azuma Hiroki 2011, Tamura en Kobayashi 2014) have instead taken a distinct dystopian turn, employing such terms as 'the People's Will 2.0', and again arguing that due the very nature of computer-mediated communication and social media, with traits such as anonymity, filter-bubbles and so-called 'echo-chambers', the individual 'will' has been reduced to a general 'will' led by emotion rather than rationality. Thus, following this logic, Internet as an open medium for communication would become an invaluable tool for political leaders utilizing a populist narrative.

    "Our discontents rather flow from informational and perceptual overload combined with a cultural acceleration neither our psyche nor our senses are that well equipped to handle. The faster we are pushed into a global future that does not inspire confidence, the stronger we feel the desire to slow down, the more we turn to memory for comfort. But what comfort from memories of the twentieth century?!?"

## Communication Study

USE MATSUDA HERE FOR SOURCES ON MEDIA USAGE IN JAPAN




While the Toronto School of communication theory has some detractors due its reliance on dichotomies, its members Harrold Innis (of "The Bias of Communication") and Mcluhan argue that the invention of print-media led to both a horizontal (regional) and vertical (chronological) continuity and structures redefining our cognitive senses, bringing about a literate 'space-biased' culture rather than an oral 'time-biased' one, and thus a heightened sense of individualism, capitalism and nationalism.[^23] With his idea of a 'global village', McLuhan however hypothesized that a shift towards electronic media, referring at the time primarily to radio and television, would again shift society. This time from a literate culture to a 'post-literate' visual culture that stimulates all senses and transcends time and space, thus leading individualism to a collective, homogeneous identity, in which the lack of a physical body or physical cues creates a different relation to oneself and one's surroundings. (McLuhan, 1962, p. 156, McLuhan 1967:63). Amongst other important early scholars within Media Studies stands Friedrich Kittler, generally associated with the German media theory school. Unlike McLuhan, who argues media as an extension of human senses, Kittler approaches media through his New Materialism theory and his concept of 'discourse networks', applying Foucoult's concept of power and archeology of knowledge in function of media, to allows media its own agency.

These ideas also fits well political scientist Benedict Anderson's notion of Imagined Communities, coined during his research on nationalism and the rise of nation-states. Anderson suggests that nations are not communities in a strict sense, but 'imagined' communities at best, implying that the sense of kinship felt between its members is but a social construct based on mutual experiences evolved from print capitalism and the rise of mass-media, and thus develop both a sense of imagined sameness, as well as clearly defined paradigm of 'otherness'. In a similar sense, social media on the Internet creates a perceived sense of affinity between its members and the social and interpersonal change of this 'global village', or 'imagined cyber-community' can be argued to transcends that of it's nation. In similar fashion, anthropologist @appadurai_modernity_1996 too already argued early on that the rise of the Internet as a new 'mediascape' would lead to the creation of new, transnational and asynchronous imagined communities, based on ideology rather than on national narratives, and diverting from traditional mass-media. Murai Shusuke (-@murai_net_2012, 375–76) argues however the opposite; precisely due Japanese Internet-users' monolingualism, not withstanding full global access through the Internet, any possibility of trans-nationality is severely limited. Within the anonymity of on-line bulletin boards such as 2channel, social markers remain thus primarily defined by language and nation-based ideology. (Naoki Sakai here?) @sakai_translation_1997


    Ideologies are present in politics in many ways. More concretely, I shall look for three specific ideological traits in this thesis. First, political actors construct and act upon images of friends and enemies – normative images of themselves as the right electoral choice in comparison to their enemies, which may be concrete (political competitors) or more abstract phenomena (e.g. capitalism, globalization). Certainly, such images need also explanations of why the cause of the protagonist is more important than other causes.


Edward Said:

The alternative to an exclusionary representational system for Said would be one that is “participatory and collaborative, non-coercive, rather than imposed”, yet he recognised the extreme difficulty involved in bringing about such an alternative.[14] Difficult because advances in the “electronic transfer of images” is increasing media concentration in the hands of powerful, transnational conglomerates.[

Furthermore, within the field of social psychology Eun-Ju Lee applies a social identity approach (focusing on deindividuation and group polarization on the internet) and argues that the lack of social signals 

## Conclusion

With the notion of the Internet as means to create a true 'global village', concerns have been raised (**by who?**) that the English-centered nature of the World Wide Web (English is the *lingua franca* of cyberspace) would lead to cultural imperialism. It is interesting then to see how relatively secluded the Japanese internetsphere and its subcultures has stayed from Western cultural hegemony, while simultaneously exerting certain influence over the English-language Internet communities.

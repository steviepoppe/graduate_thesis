abstractjp1: "それぞれの国の言語で主流となっておる「オルタナ右翼」（alt-right）、「fachosphère」または「ネット右翼」（いわゆるネトウヨ）は、サイバー空間における右翼ポピュリズムの高揚あるいは右傾化に関連される現象を指している。本稿はこの現象をサイバーナショナリズムとして概念し、それぞれの用語を地域的な表現として読まれておる。そのために、本稿はまず「ネット右翼」に関する文献調査を行い、次にサイバーナショナリズムの理論的枠組みを構築されておる。最後に、本稿は「ネット右翼」に関連されるSNSに混合研究法のコンテンツ分析を行われる。"
abstractjp2: "本稿の理論的枠組みは、西ドイツのフランクフルト学派の批判理論に基づき、そこから右翼ポピュリストのレトリック及び主題を解釈すると、グラムシ（Gramsci）の論理的な風味が明らかにされる。すなわち、既成の政治制度、左翼期間または主流メディアが果たしている役割とは「エリート」というヘゲモニー的（覇権的）イデオロギーに、道具的に「庶民」の同意を製造されるものである。その上に、その覇権的イデオロギーは（自己認識の）社会問題（すなわち、マリクスの矛盾）から逸脱され、「庶民」または「世論」を充分に代表されない。従って、想像されるハーバーマス（Habermas）の公共圏と解釈されるインターネットは、カウンター（反覇権的）イデオロギーの普及に好適だと思われる。"
abstractjp3: "しかしながら、さまざまな超国家主義的な市民運動（在特会を含むいわゆる保守行動運動）が存在し、「ネット右翼」というその言葉自体がジャパンファースト党などの反体制派の右翼ポピュリストのために適切な有権者の存在を意味しているにもかかわらず、自由民主党は今まで政治を掌握している。本稿の概説は、 2016年を初めにポピュリスト新参者がサイバーナショナリストによって感じられる既成の政治制度、左翼期間または主流メディアへの不信をを利用している一方で、自民党は2011年の地震をきっかけにより早くそれを達成した。自民党が文化産業の「ソフトパワー」を通じて広めたヘゲモニー的イデオロギーは、日本におけるサイバーナショナリストをそのままにしていない。さらに、自民党は公的憤懣を起こし、世の中におけるカウンター・ヘゲモニー的運動を達成している（自己認識の）社会的問題を利用して日本におけるサイバーナショナリストに訴えかけている。"
abstract1: "Terms such as *alt-right*, *fachosphère* and *Netto-Uyoku* have in their respective languages entered the mainstream discourse and refer to a phenomenon of online-based right-wing populist nationalism. This paper intends to conceptualize this phenomenon as cyber-nationalism, adopting a mixed method (quantitative and computer-assisted) content analysis to media-platforms associated with the Japanese cyber-nationalists known as Netto-Uyoku."
abstract2: "We find the Frankfurt School approach to ideological critique suitable to theoretically ground our research. A reading of right-wing populist rhetoric reveals a distinct flavor of Gramscian logic therein: established politics, left-wing institutions and mainstream media manufacture consent to the hegemonic ideology of the elite, which does not adequately represent the people’s will and defers from self-perceived contradictions in society. The Internet as an imagined Habermasian public sphere is then ideal for disseminating counter-hegemonic ideologies. "
abstract3: "Yet despite the existence of ultra-nationalist grassroots movements as the Zaitokukai, and the term Netto-Uyoku itself implying a prevalent electorate for Japanese right-wing populists as Sakurai Makoto, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has retained its grip on politics. For this, we hypothesize that while populist newcomers have on a global scale capitalized on the distrust of established institutions experienced by these cyber-nationalists, the LDP has effectively done this earlier in the wake of the 2011 earthquake. We then find two elements contributing to the LDP's success amongst Japanese cyber-nationalists: 1.) the ideological hegemony spread by the LDP through the state-sponsored soft-power of its culture industry has not left Japanese cyber-nationalists untouched; and 2.) the LDP appeals to Japanese cyber-nationalists by manufacturing public outrage and exploiting the same self-perceived contradictions in society that have led to counter-hegemonic movements elsewhere."

On August 28, 2010 *The New York Times* published an article titled "New Dissent in Japan Is Loudly Anti-Foreign," referring to a rise in politically motivated protest marches associated with a supposed Japanese 'Net-Right'. In his article, Martin Fackler describes this 'Net-Right' (hereinafter referred to by its Japanese term *Netto-Uyoku* ネット右翼)[^2] as "a new type of ultranationalist group" and "a virtual community." He goes on to state that "while these groups remain a small if noisy fringe element here, they have won growing attention as an alarming side effect of Japan’s long economic and political decline" [@fackler_new_2010-1]. Yet it is a small fringe element that is nevertheless noisy enough to reach print press in the United States. In its most commonly applied form the term Netto-Uyoku applies to a loosely connected, decentralized group of Internet users disseminating a form of extreme right-wing discourse online and who are active primarily on social media platforms such as Twitter, the anonymous messaging board 2channel (*2-channeru* 2ちゃんねる),[^12] and streaming services such as YouTube and Niconico (ニコニコ).[^58]

Far from benign expressions of free speech limited to shadowy corners of the Internet, consequences of such outings have however very much crossed digital boundaries and materialized in disquieting, at times even violent ways. As Fackler alluded to in his *New York Times* piece, the Netto-Uyoku are often name-called in the same breath as neo-nationalist organizations like the *Zaitokukai* and *Shukenkai*[^7]—or to use the jargon of those organizations, *Action Conservative Movements* (ACM).[^9] Furthermore, according to a 2016 investigation by the Japanese department of Justice, a total of 1152 protest marches, xenophobic in nature and associated with the ACM, were found to be held across Japan between the period April 2012 and September 2015 [@nikaido_eng:_2016]. Makoto Sakurai, founder of the Zaitokukai and one key figure associated with the ACM and Netto-Uyoku, has been arrested for violence associated with such protest marches, stepping down as its leader in 2014. He did however remain a prolific political commentator online, going on to form the populist right-wing Japan First Party in 2016, holding their first convention in a hotel of the equally controversial Toshio Motoya owned APA Group.[^128]

Nevertheless, nearly a decade after Fackler's publication in *The New York Times*, academic coverage of the Netto-Uyoku and related topics such as the ACM and Zaitokukai remains relatively scarce, with some exceptions including the seminal work *Netto to Aikoku* (ネットと愛国, "The Internet and Patriotism") by journalist Yasuda Koichi [-@yasuda_eng:_2012], and writings by @tsuji_eng:_2008, @murai_net_2012, @yamaguchi_xenophobia_2013, @higuchi_japans_2014 and @morris-suzuki_beyond_2015. Moreover, whenever the topic does reach mainstream outlets, there appears to be a tendency to frame the Netto-Uyoku as little more than a fringe movement and side-effect of economic malaise with little real-life influence [@furuya_roots_2016].[^5] This is in spite of the fact that, as shown above, actions associated with this movement have had real-life consequences, not the least of which includes the 2016 adoption of an anti-discrimination law in order to curb hate speech.[^116] Additionally, a 2017 paper on political bots in Japan suggests a hidden nationalist agenda of Prime Minister Abe Shinzō tied to that of the Netto-Uyoku, and views them as a potential "enormous online support army of Abe’s agenda" [@schafer_japans_2017], something that the author of this paper too has previously alluded to.[^14] Furthermore, a political booklet handed out to LDP lawmakers in the Diet before the July 2019 election was in a 2019 interview with Ishiba Shigeru (former Minister of Defense and political rival to Abe Shinzō) explicitly criticized as a 'Netto-Uyoku book' [@bungeishunju_editorial_department_eng._2019].[^109] Although the publisher of this booklet, Internet media-website TerracePRESS, claims to have been widely viewed since its establishment one year prior, the *Huffington Post Japan* reports there was no data available on monthly visits (indicating that the number was too low too include) and that the meta-data of its website block it from being indexed by search-engines such as Google [@tanaka_eng._2019].

It goes without saying that expressions of neo-nationalist sentiment taking place largely within the confines of cyberspace are by no means limited to Japanese territory. First of all, the outcome of the United States' 2016 presidential elections, the 2016 British Brexit-referendum and the rise of neo-nationalist ideology amongst various European political campaigns reflect greater global political struggles. We can next argue that the role of the Internet, social media and software was of no small importance in those outcomes either, considering the extent it penetrated our daily lives. Facebook, for example, came under strong public scrutiny in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal (in which it came to light that illicitly obtained personal data of up to 87 million Facebook users were used for political advertising and data-analysis in favor of Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and the British Leave.EU campaign).[^46] Moreover, backing the cult of personality of presidents Vladimir Putin, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Xi Jinping, to name a few, as well as the 2016 elected president of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte, are supposed 'online troll armies'. These 'troll armies' deliberately, and both on a voluntary or paid basis, spread disinformation on social media and attack self-perceived enemies of their respective presidents. They have on multiple instances been accredited with manipulation of political discourse online in order to influence elections, including in more recent memory the 2016 presidential elections in the United States [@benedictus_invasion_2016]. A practice Marko Kovic defined in the case of state-sponsored Internet propaganda, as 'digital *astroturfing*', calling it "a form of manufactured, deceptive and strategic top-down activity on the Internet initiated by political actors that mimics bottom-up activity by autonomous individuals" [-@kovic_digital_2018, p.71].

Moreover, the *Alt-Right* (arguably the western counterparts to the Netto-Uyoku and associated primarily with the United States) have drawn much ire after a white nationalist terror attack (i.e. ideologically driven violence) in Charlottesville, Virginia during its Unite the Right rally,[^29] and again after little public disavowal by the President of the United States.[^24] In a similar fashion and overlapping ideologically with the Alt-Right, we then find associated foremost with (Western) Europe, Australia and New Zealand the so-called *Identitarian Movement*. It should be noted too that the perpetrator of the March 2019 terror attack in New Zealand sprinkled his manifesto with deeply ironic Internet-driven sub-culture rhetoric inherent to those movements. During the terror attack, he referenced an online trend concerning Swedish YouTube influencer Felix Khellberg (known for making video-game related videos through his online handler *PewDiePie* and as of writing subscribed to by over 95 million followers). Moreover, in his manifesto the perpetrator describes himself as "just an ordinary White (*sic*) man, 28 years old" and references a white supremacy conspiracy theory popularized by Alt-Right YouTube influencer and Canadian far-right Internet media-platform The Rebel Media contributor Lauren Southern.[^4] 

In Belgium, the mid-2019 elected politician Dries van Langenhove (aligned with populist far right party Vlaams Belang, lit. 'Flemish Interest') also acquired attention through his mimicry of rhetoric used by online-based far-right nationalist movements including the Alt-Right on platforms as Facebook and gaming chat application Discord (which was brought to light in a 2018 documentary on the Belgian Identitarian youth movement *Schild & Vrienden*).[^30] The second largest party in Belgium after the 2019 elections, Vlaams Belang's online campaign took inspiration from both the 2016 Brexit campaign and Trump campaign, investing dominantly on social media advertisements and targeting young voters aged 18 to 34 [@cerulus_inside_2019]. Furthermore, in another intersection with the Alt-Right, Vlaams Belang leader Tom Van Grieken hosted an event debating the UN migration pact with, amongst others, Steve Bannon [@gotev_vlaams_2018], and a youth subdivision of Vlaams Belang invited Lauren Southern as guest-speaker during another congress supervised by Van Grieken [@rennenberg_vlaams_2018]. In France, the term *fachosphère* denotes similar trends on the French Internet and *Le Monde* published a series of articles linking Marine Le Pen's populist far-right Front National, online video-game community jeuxvideo.com and `Internet trolls' [@laurent_nordactu_2016;@audureau_les_2017].[^16] In South Korea, the populist far-right Liberty Korea Party (LKP) has been condemned for its usage of 'online Internet trolls'. Furthermore, its former chairman, previous presidential candidate and YouTuber Hong Joon-Pyo has seen comparisons to Donald Trump [@he-rim_firebrand_2018;@bo-gyung_youtube_2019]. Finally, the online media-platform Ilbe Storage is described as hosting the South Korean equivalent of the Japanese Netto-Uyoku [@shim_hardcore_2015]. 

Whether or not the actions of those online movements had any measurable effect on the outcome of the elections is wholly debatable, but in light of the above information, it is at the very least sensible to claim the Internet as a medium plays an undeniably important role, not just in the organization of neo-nationalist movements, but in shaping elements of its discourse as well; a narrative that is by the way increasingly amplified by numerous mainstream news outlets. One Politico reporter states that "Just about everyone else, if they’re aware of these efforts at all, assumes they amounted to little more than entertainment for bored geeks and some unpleasant episodes for the targets of its often racist and sexist harassment campaigns. After all, the idea that a swarm of socially alienated trolls played a meaningful role in a multibillion-dollar presidential campaign by, among other gambits, relentlessly spreading images of a cartoon frog is at least as ridiculous as the idea that a billionaire TV entertainer could win that campaign" [@schreckinger_world_2017].[^26]

Furthermore, Japan's international *soft power* (non-coercive political influence) has in no doubt left its mark on many of those communities abroad, seeping particularly into the Alt-Right and Identitarian Movement.[^32] To name some examples, former Donald Trump strategist and Breitbart News Network owner Steve Bannon participated as a speaker at the 2017 *Japanese Conservative Political Action Conference* (J-CPAC) and praised Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as being "Trump before Trump." Alt-Right and Identitarian Movement associates including white supremacists Richard Spencer (who coined the term Alt-Right) and Jared Taylor (who himself was born in Japan and speaks fluent Japanese) often sing praise of Japan as an exemplary *ethno-state*. Finally, other such Alt-Right associates include Vice Magazine[^131] co-founder and Proud Boys founder Gavin McInnes. Founder of a far-right male-only organization driven by the white genocide conspiracy theory and notorious for inciting violence, Gavin McInnes has since gone on to write for the Canadian far-right Internet media-platform The Rebel Media, and in 2018 participated in a reenactment of the 1960 assassination of Japanese Socialist Party (JSP) chairman Inejiro Asanuma by ultra-nationalist Otoya Yamaguchi [@feuer_founder_2018]. Journalist Audrea Lim, in her *The New York Times* editorial, even goes so far to assert "yellow fever" (a sexual obsession with those of Asian descent) as a common trait amongst the Alt-Right, stating that many public figures in the movement have had documented relationships with Asian women [-@lim_opinion_2018].[^20]

This soft power influence is observable on a grass-roots level as well. @charity_why_2016, for example, reports on the increasingly common phenomenon of encountering online imagery containing politically-tinted Japanese animation characters (wearing political symbols ranging from neo-Nazi symbols to Trump-related iconography such as *Make American Great Again* hats). The fully English anonymous messaging board *4chan* in particular[^17] (since September 2015 publicly owned by *2channel* founder Hiroyuki Nishimura) started in 2003 as a North-American copy of its Japanese equivalents text-board *2channel* and image-board *Futaba Channel* with an intended focus on discussing Japanese pop-culture [@orsini_how_2015], but came under heavy scrutiny in 2014 for its association with the *Gamergate* controversy and the Alt-Right. The former, a co-ordinated harassment campaign against women targeting sexism in video game culture and the multi-billion video game industry, can be interpreted both as protest against diversification of a supposed gamer identity (a cultural identity that has traditionally been associated with men) and as part of a larger reactionary online *culture war* over conservative and progressive ideologies.[^18] Moreover, preliminary research on such microcosmic English language Internet communities (such as the political discussion section of 4chan, 4chan spin-off *8chan* and the conservative political section of *Reddit*) observes strong neo-nationalist rhetoric exemplary of the Alt-Right. 

8chan in particular has been described as a more radical spin-off of 4chan. An anonymous post on this message-board linked to a live-stream of New Zealand terror attack, suggesting that the perpetrator was active on 8chan [@brewster_after_2019]. Prior to the 2019 Poway synagogue terror attack, a user on 8chan signed their post with the name of the alleged shooter, and in a similar fashion to the Christchurch perpetrator, posted a manifesto referencing the white genocide conspiracy theory and Internet sub-culture elements [@collins_anti-semitic_2019; @stewart_8chan_2019]. On July 26, 2019 a *New York Times* article on this Reddit sub-community, *The_Donald*, reports that after repeated incitement of violence aimed increasingly at police officers and public officials, the forum has now been 'quarantined'. This means that its content is no longer algorithmically featured on the front-page of the platform, that users have to log-in and specifically agree to enter this sub-community, and that no revenue will be generated through ads [@chokshi_reddit_2019]. Reportedly, both Donald Trump's 2016 campaign manager and social media manager visit The_Donald on a daily basis [@parscale_reddit_2016;@restuccia_get_2019] and Donald Trump himself was reported to give a Q&A in the community as well [@robertson_donald_2016]. This research further argues those Internet communities to be hubs for influencing mainstream political discourse and setting "the narrative agenda for mainstream media outlets" [@hine_kek_2016; @pearson_scientists_2016; @zannettou_web_2017; @zannettou_origins_2018]. Alt-right appropriated *viral* imagery (in colloquial terms known as 'memes')[^19] such as that of a green anthropomorphic frog ('Pepe the Frog') find their roots in those communities as well, and have been shared in some form by members of the current White House, including Donald Trump and Donald Trump Jr. [@lee_understanding_2016; @ohlheiser_analysis_2016; @phillips_alt-right_2016]. 

Thus, to reiterate, an increase of mainstream news reports, as mentioned above, claim occidental online communities with an origin in discussing Japanese pop-culture are effectively 1. hotbeds for right-wing radicalization, and 2. important electoral spaces for both right-wing populist political parties attacking established institutions and for politically motivated citizen movements in the United States and Europe. Members of those movements have praised Japan as the ideal of an 'ethno-state', and have themselves gained political traction outside the realm of the digital. Moreover, this chapter discussed this to be part of a global trend of neo-nationalist discourse on the Internet and claimed that terms as *fachosphere*, Netto-Uyoku and Alt-Right are conceived of as expressions of such phenomena. Nevertheless the *fachosphere*, for example, refers uniquely to the French cyberspace in which such a discourse finds place (with the added connotation of fascist ideology), while the Alt-Right, now as a term unquestionably grown beyond its intended use, was originally conceived of as a particular ideological citizens movement in the United States. 

As I will demonstrate in the next chapter, a common factor in literature on the Netto-Uyoku is the connection with ideologically driven ACM movements like the Zaitokukai (arguably the actual counterpoint to the original Alt-Right). The term Netto-Uyoku ('net-right) however, leans in its literal meaning most closely to this phenomenon of Internet-driven right-wing populist nationalism; a phenomenon I would like to further conceptualize as the ideological movement of *cyber-nationalism* (i.e. a form of neo-nationalism centered around the peculiarities of the Internet as a medium). Although overlapping with recent conceptualizations of neo-nationalism, the *neo* aspect does not yet permit enough agency to the Internet as a medium. After all, "the medium is the message" as McLuhan famously describes, and with roots in libertarian counter-culture movements, so too is the Internet and World Wide Web ideologically driven [@markoff_what_2005]. @azuma_ippan_2011, @tamura_niggling_2014 argue similar to McLuhan argued that the very nature of electronic media would shrink the world into a 'global village' or bring about a 'General Will 2.0' and cause social change through increased social and political involvement and awareness. In this Utopian view would the Internet as medium then, precisely because of the general lack of gate-keepers and the dual role of the Internet-user as both consumer and producer, serve as perfect representation of McLuhan's 'global village'.[^21]

In this chapter, I have also argued that the space of the Internet is increasingly politicized and fertile soil for both grass-roots levels of Internet activism as large-scale political warfare. Within the context of Internet and politics, academics have to various degrees hypothesized on the contribution of the Internet to political polarization, on the Internet's utilization by political actors applying populist strategies, and on the media effects of so-called 'new media' on its users regarding political awareness and opinion-forming. @sunstein_republic:_2017, for example, writes about the impact to democracy of so-called online echo chambers—reinforcement of one's ideas through repeated confrontation with opinions and news aligning with one's ideas). Although deliberate misinformation ('fake news') is by no means a new trend either,[^11] this too has thrived due to the Internet's widespread usage. The lack of moderation and the spontaneity of social network platforms facilitates the (conscious) spreading and sharing of false information (or information seen loose of its context), without reflection or without source control, and has potentially far-reaching political consequences. 

My first hypothesis thus far is that those described as Netto-Uyoku are ideologically similar to the Alt-Right and other such loosely connected movements occurring on the Internet. But if we are to read the Netto-Uyoku as a localized embodiment of such a global phenomenon of counter-establishment neo-nationalism occurring on cyberspace, why then are the Netto-Uyoku perceived of as being supportive of the LDP and Abe Shinzō (a politician that is by all means of the word part of the political establishment)? For that, I hypothesize the following: whereas political newcomers and anti-establishment have on a global scale capitalized on the distrust of established institutions experienced by these cyber-nationalists, the LDP has effectively done this earlier in the wake of the 2011 earthquake and waning popularity of the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), by specifically appealing to the Netto-Uyoku ideology and deterring from the anti-establishment elements of populist ideology. 

Based on this premise, several other questions come to mind:

- How then should we define Netto-Uyoku and cyber-nationalist ideology?
- Are there similar trends of *online culture wars* on Japanese social media?[^10]
- What processes do Netto-Uyoku employ to disseminate ideology?
- Following McLuhan, how then do the media platforms the Netto-Uyoku utilize operate technically?
- How does the movement organize and mobilize, both online and in real life?
- Is there possible space for furthering a Netto-Uyoku political agenda through influencing its international counterparts?

This paper consists of four chapters, including this introductory first chapter wherein I tried to draw the Netto-Uyoku in a wider, global context and not regard it as a uniquely Japanese *Galápagos syndrome* phenomenon (although its idiosyncrasies are in no doubt shaped by Japanese occurrences, as seen in the framing of @azuma_otaku:_2001 and @kitada__2008). To substantiate the above hypotheses and answer those subquestions, the second chapter intents to build a narrative on the Netto-Uyoku through a literature review of both seminal and newer writings. As a relatively young and volatile term, 'Netto-Uyoku' has gone through several shifts in meaning, with earlier works viewing the Netto-Uyoku not as an actual group with group awareness, but loosely as people utilizing the Internet and engaging in aggressive, politically-driven rhetoric online [@sasaki_netto-uyoku_2005]. Early scholarly work referring to the Netto-Uyoku does so in a greater context debating politicians with populist tendencies (in particular Toru Hashimoto and Shintaro Ishihara), the historical revisionist organization Nippon Kaigi, or the actions of ACM-affiliated protest movements as Zaitokukai. The online messaging board 2channel is however a red line throughout these works, as well as occasional references to the online video-channel Channel Sakurai, video-services Niconico, YouTube and social media platform Twitter. Those works have far often viewed the Netto-Uyoku in a greater debate of (trans)national identity, discrimination and of questions to what qualifies as freedom of speech [@tsuji_eng:_2008;@yasuda_eng:_2012;@yasuda_:_2013;@murai_net_2012;@morris-suzuki_beyond_2015]. Two exceptions are @azuma__2007 and @kitada__2008, who have both connected the Netto-Uyoku with a cynical nihilism amongst 2channel-users in the wake of the economic crisis known as the Lost Decade.

With the widespread usage of the term *Netto-Uyoku* (and in particular its pejorative abbreviation *neto-uyo*), those at the receiving end of this critique have had ambiguous reactions. Some denounced the term (a common thread is the normative implication that they are merely 'normal Japanese citizens' voicing the concerns of the people), while others have mockingly appropriated it (as is the case, for example, with Zaitokukai-founder Makoto Sakurai). Through the social constructionist act of naming this phenomenon, so thus arises a group identity with discursive implications of both in-group normalization and out-group polarization. State of the art literature in contrast discusses and hypothesize on the socio-cultural background of the Netto-Uyoku, as well as on its ideology, demography and *modus operandi* [@schafer_japans_2017;@kitada_owaranai_2018;@kurahashi_:_2018;@ota_saraba_2019;@yasuda_:_2019]. This paper then too intents to read the Netto-Uyoku not as a noisy fringe element of Japanese society, but as an ideologically driven movement with political agency, and keeping in mind the context laid out in this chapter, the power to exert influence on public discourse. While refraining from taking too hard a technological determined position towards the Internet (the implication being that the existence of the Internet as a medium would by itself be a leading cause for societal change),[^22] and instead treats the Netto-Uyoku in part as a symptom of deeper cultural malaise, this paper does suggest that by no means should the Internet be dismissed as merely a tool of communication either.

The third chapter lays down a Frankfurt School inspired lens of theory through which this paper reads the Netto-Uyoku, based on this author's understanding of ideology, populism and neo-nationalism. This is done through the reasoning of thinkers associated with the Western Marxist tradition or Frankfurt School of critical theory: Antonio Gramsci, Theodor W. Adorno, Walter Benjamin and Jürgen Habermas—juxtaposing this with concrete historical applications leading up to the present state in which the Netto-Uyoku arises. In contextualizing populism, this chapter follow @taggart_populism_2000, @laclau_populist_2005 and @mudde_oxford_2013 in their definitions of populism as a *thin-centered* ideology antagonizing a homogeneous elite in contrast to *the People's Will*, a homogeneous group of *ordinary people*, utilizing an *us versus them* dichotomy. It then further analyzes compatibility with a so-called "Japanese model of populism" (*nihongata popyurizumu*, 「日本型ポピュリズム」) as described by Japanese scholars such as @otake__2003, @kimura__2006, Matsutani Mitsuru [-@matsutani__2009; -@matsutani_eng:_2010], @yoshida__2011, and @kobori_populism_2013. This chapter also draws on the work of @anderson_imagined_2006 for his notion of *imagined communities* and Azuma Hiroki for his concepts of *General Will 2.0* in relation to Internet-based forms of populism, and *animalization* within the context of Lukács's *reification* [-@azuma_otaku:_2001;-@azuma_ippan_2011].

The fourth chapter attempt to further lay bare underlying ideological structures by conducting a mixed method content analysis of what is to be understood as Netto-Uyoku rhetoric, building on @van_dijk_politics_2006 and @fairclough_media_2010. This chapter focuses particularly on two overlooked media-platforms in dispersing Netto-Uyoku thought: Wikipedia and 2channel aggregation sites. This chapter then pays particular attention to the *modus operandi* of each platform as well as the peculiarities of the Internet itself. Support for Japanese characters on Internet addresses (URLs) is, for example, relatively new, and thus are Japanese website URLs and many profile names on social made dominantly written in the Latin alphabet (in the process hinting at a technologically-determined hegemonic nature of the medium of the World Wide Web itself). Finally, this chapter expands on one particular event in recent Netto-Uyoku history: The 'Netto-Uyoku Ban Matsuri' (*neto-uyo ban matsuri* ネトウヨBAN祭り). Earlier I inquired on the existence of a Japanese equivalent of online culture wars. While setting up the outline of my paper, this question answered itself. The latter uses methods of mass-reporting on YouTube and Twitter for automatic removal of Netto-Uyoku related accounts.

On a closing note, it should be mentioned that any research involving the Internet and social networks online is bound to have some risks and limitations. In this case risks and limitations involve liquidity of data, copyright laws pertaining to acquiring data and lack of reliability due anonymity masking intent of the user.[^57] As referred to earlier, one issue that arose during my writing process was the effect of an on-going online *culture war* between Netto-Uyoku members and anti-hate speech movements. I concur that limiting public access to ideological extremist material reduces chances of radicalization,[^55] but for the purposes of research it drastically impacted my ability to assess network influence and trickle-down effects of extremist rhetoric on mainstream platforms. Other issues are the extraction of online data from an ethical viewpoint and the concept of informed consent, more so in light of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The dataset contains data created independent of the researcher on platforms that are explicitly open (2channel, *matome*-blogs and Wiki-style encyclopedias). In other words, data that is openly available to group-outsiders and explicitly intended to be so (including user-names) on online spaces that are not expected to be private spaces. It is therefore reasonable to argue that obtaining informed consent is not applicable in this case.

Japanese and Korean names are written in the autonomous usage, with family name preceding the given name. Macrons have been used to identify long vowels in Japanese, with the exception of well-known place names such as Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto.

#The Netto-Uyoku — A Literature Review

To demonstrate the extent of reach the term Netto-Uyoku has had, this paper's introduction touched upon a late 2010 print article in *The New York Times*. It goes without saying that the term has been in use much earlier. The first English language mention in mainstream press dates back to March 14, 2006, when Journalist Eric Johnston published a *The Japan Times* piece on right-wing nationalism and the Internet in Japan, "Net boards venue for faceless rightists." In his article, Johnston associates these 'faceless rightists' (who he further refers to as *Net Uyoku*) with hate-speech towards Koreans, the anonymous messaging board 2channel, online video channel Channel Sakura and the conservative political organization *Nippon Kaigi* [@johnston_net_2006]. In Japan, the term first reached print press in a 2005 *Mainichi Shimbun* article by @sasaki_netto-uyoku_2005, who describes the Netto-Uyoku as a 'new conservative public opinion' (*shin hoshu-tekina yoron*, 新保守的な世論) that was able to sprout precisely to Internet as a medium.

 \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth,trim=4 4 4 4,clip]{images/nettouyoku2.eps}
\end{figure}

Furthermore, **figure \ref{fig:nettouyoku}** reveals that while Google search results gained a small peak after Sasaki's article, relative interest in the subject drastically increased since mid-2009, with further peaks coinciding with election lead-ups (such as former Prime Minister Naoto Kan's resignation and subsequent party election and the December 2012 general election). This graph further shows that the more pejorative 'neto-uyo' (「ネトウヨ」) overtakes the more neutral 'netto-uyoku' 「ネット右翼」 in usage from mid-2009 onwards.[^34] It is around this period too that academic interest in the Netto-Uyoku starts to increase.

##Who are the Netto-Uyoku?

In one of the earlier English language publications by those in academia, Tessa Morris-Suzuki[^60] [-@morris-suzuki_freedom_2013] warns against the dangers of social media as a tool for populist mobilization, and paradoxical usage of the empty signifier 'freedom of speech'. While not explicitly using the term Netto-Uyoku or *net-right*, she describes trends of "violently xenophobic or racist messages, recycling wartime language and imagery that had long disappeared from public discourse in Japan" on the anonymous Internet forum *2channel* as a trend of "Internet nationalism". Based on a 2012 social media white paper showcasing 2channel users to be predominantly young and male, she frames this group as "lonely, frustrated *otaku* (an isolated person with obsessive interests), probably unemployed or in a dead-end job, seeking some sense of identity by sharing anger and bitterness with nameless others." She further hints that as the social media-scape shifts, so too then finds this 2channel-inspired Netto-Uyoku discourse its way to other platforms. The image of lonely Netto-Uyoku as *otaku* seeking comfort in nationalism and group-bonding online is indeed a compelling narrative, if potentially stereotypical and through such usage of polemic language at risk of drawing backlash.

Several years earlier @tsuji_eng:_2008 made a first attempt at drawing a quantitative  view of the Netto-Uyoku demographic. By holding an online survey with 998 valid participants, Tsuji tries to map polarization (basing himself on Cass R.
Sunstein's notion of *group polarization*) and right-wing radicalization amongst Internet-users, using the following traits to identify Netto-Uyoku:

1. Feelings of antagonism towards China and Korea
2. Agreement to the Prime Minister's visit to the Yasukuni Shrine[^125]
3. Agreement towards the revision of Article 9 of the constitution[^65]
4. Agreeing with the display of the national flag and singing the national anthem in elementary and middle schools
5. Having written on social or political issues on one's website, or commented and engaged in discussion on social media online

Out of his sample, thirteen people had strong agreements to all of the above (1.3 percent) and when eased to agreement of three items including the fifth point did this number increase to thirty-one (3.1 percent). Tsuji concludes that based on these early findings, Netto-Uyoku are indeed dominantly male, frequently participate on 2channel, and have a negative bias towards mass communication. Moreover, through a multiple regression analysis he concludes that a higher frequency in usage of 2channel correlates with stronger feelings of patriotism and exclusivism. Although some concerns could be raised on the amount of Netto-Uyoku willing to truthfully participate in a "survey on social awareness",[^123] not to mention that the survey itself was targeting only users between the ages of 20 and 44, this confirm at least in empirical way tendencies of right-wing polarization on 2channel. As seen in **table \ref{tab:tsuji}**, he further expands this research in 2014, publishing his findings in a 2017 paper (this time with a broader reach of 2347 participants with an age between 20 and 59; results limited to the age-group 20 - 44 are added in brackets).

\end{table}

While his conclusions on Netto-Uyoku are not drastically different from before (finding no significant discrepancies in academic background or income), he confirms that Netto-Uyoku prefer anonymous communication tools such as 2channel and the video service Niconico over Facebook or the messaging service LINE. He further suggests that while there is not much of an increase in users actively attempting to disseminate their political opinions, there is at least an increase in latent Netto-Uyoku behavior when taking in mind the starch rise in reactionary and xenophobic sentiment[^133] [@tsuji_eng._2017].[^124]   

In another early academic work on the Netto-Uyoku, @sakamoto_koreans_2011 discusses the Netto-Uyoku (what she abbreviated as *netto-uyo*) as a form of "Internet nationalism in contemporary Japan". She too connects the Netto-Uyoku to Niconico, Channel Sakura and 2channel, and similar to @tsuji_eng:_2008 describes the Netto-Uyoku as adhering to the following views [@sakamoto_koreans_2011, pp.2-4]:

> Mirroring the post-1990s historical revisionism, netto-uyo exhibit xenophobia towards immigrants, depict Korea and China negatively, and uphold revisionist history, justifying and glorifying Japan’s wartime actions. They also support political leaders’ official visits to Yasukuni Shrine, revision of Article 9 of the constitution, and patriotic education.

>"Netto-uyo’s ‘we the Japanese’ does not even include all ethnic Japanese, as those who do not share their values (liberals, left-wingers, feminists, supporters of non-Japanese residents’ rights, Korean TV drama fans etc.) are all considered potential enemies of
the nation."

@kitada__2008 too views the development of the world wide web in Japan as intrinsically linked to the lost decade(s), the long-lasting economic recession since the early '90s, with the particular subculture developed on *2channel* as a cynical nihilism derived from the post-bubble economic crisis, and one that through its consumption of irony gave room for nationalism. (mention of Aum Shinrikyo¯ Tokyo subway sarin gas attack and the
Kobe earthquake)

##2channel, Niconico, Baudrillard

2channel is an anonymous message-board developed by Hiroyuki Nishimura (at the time an exchange student in the United States). In a 2007 Wired article, @katayama_2-channel_2007 described 2channel as the biggest bulletin board system in the world—with 2.5 million posts a day—and paraphrased Daisuke Okabe[^129] as saying 2channel is for its users a place "where people can combat the mass media on a grass-roots level". This phrasing already implies a subconscious reasoning of the Internet as the ideological Other to the mass-media; and in language evoking warfare, a scene of combat as well. This article further quotes 2channel founder Nishimura as reacting to "more than 50 civil lawsuits in Tokyo alone and more than $4 million in settlements and court penalties for libel, defamation, copyright violations, privacy and personal injury," that he does not have "any intention of paying up to a country whose laws I don't respect" [@katayama_2-channel_2007], again implying an atmosphere of rebelliousness. It must be noted however that Hiroyuki Nishimura has since lost legal ownership of 2channel to the owner of the extreme right-wing 4chan spin-off *8chan*, Jim Watkins [@silverman_meet_2017], and in turn himself became owner of 4chan. Furthermore, since Jim Watkins' take-over, 2channel now links to 8chan on its front-page.[^38]

@sakamoto_koreans_2011 herself describes 2channel[^134] as "'not for the faint of heart', this unmoderated forum is known to be the main outlet for revisionism and xenophobic neonationalism of the internet generation." Furthermore, of its usage by Netto-Uyaku she claims that "[a]lthough netto-uyo is not exclusive to 2-chan, 2-chan is the main playground for netto-uyo, where this phenomenon developed," [-@sakamoto_koreans_2011, p2]. According to her analysis, the majority of comments deferred from the original topic at hand and serve simply to reinforce a negative portrayal of Koreans as the cultural Other; that is to say, an empty signifier symbolizing that what is "'inferior', 'dirty', 'shameless', 'primitive', 'violent', and 'irrational'", which then in the process implies the Japanese participants on these threats to be the opposite [@sakamoto_koreans_2011, p.7].


Although Sakamoto distances herself from the determinist idea that the existence of the Internet itself as a medium is a prime lead to neo-nationalism, she concurs that the nationalism occurring on 2channel is not an extension of preexisting nationalism, saying that "discourses that develop on the Internet may exhibit different characteristics from those that form outside the Internet," and further arguing that "[a]s one of the many strands of nationalism that constitute contemporary Japan’s neonationalist landscape," "2-chan online nationalism should not be dismissed as mere chatter," [@sakamoto_koreans_2011, p.13]. Instead, so she continues, "[a]lthough netto-uyo nationalism currently remains largely within cyberspace, and although cynicism seems to prevail over modernist commitment to a fixed meaning, the potential for its politicisation and mobilisation exists," [-@sakamoto_koreans_2011, p.13].

We see this discrepancy between the neo-nationalism associated with the Netto-Uyoku and ACM and 'traditional' nationalism, by the way, in the starch rejection of these movements by what might be considered traditional far-right movements in Japan. **rejection of netto uyoku** 



Moving away from views of neo-nationalism on the Internet decidedly as an expression of social anxiety, @sakamoto_koreans_2011 shifts her point of focus on the discursive practices of building identity and nationalism online. For that, she conducts a content analysis of one thread on 2channel, involving the discussion of a YouTube clip on Tsushima Island,[^130] which gained 7000 reactions over a time span of four days. 

>>"Collectively, the 7,000 postings produced and reinforced the negative image of Korea and Koreans far beyond the Tsushima issue. Forum participants brought up a multitude of Korea related issues which had nothing to do with Korean tourists on Tsushima: the ‘special tax and welfare privileges’ that zainichi Koreans allegedly enjoy, the ‘illegal occupation’ of Takeshima Island’, kimchi with parasite eggs, or crimes by Koreans in Japan and overseas. Links were made to a TV news item about a Japanese boy who was attacked in Korea, snapshots of anti-Japanese artwork by Korean school children, a Youtube clip on a rape by a zainichi Korean, 2-chan threads on zainichi pension entitlement and welfare benefits, shocking images of anti-Japanese demonstrators slaughtering pheasants (Japan’s national bird) in front of the Japanese Embassy, and many more. These and other unrelated events and images are linked together under the unifying but empty sign of the 'Koreans'," [@sakamoto_koreans_2011, p.5].

Sakamoto discusses the often decontextualized, historically revisionist (or rather, ahistoric) usage of events and imagery in this thread in the context of French sociologist Baudrillard's theorization of simulacra, simulation, the hyper-real and the construction of reality. Although this is but one interpretation of highly dense theory, simulation for Baudrillard has in consumerist society come to no longer *represent* or *copy* reality, but is through discursive processes a *real* that is not grounded in reality; or to put it in Baudrillard's exact words "a real without origin or reality". For Baudrillard, culture and media replace our understanding of an '*actual*' reality and meaning with simulations and simulacra; with the *idea* of reality. [@sakamoto_koreans_2011, p.9] argues as follows:

>Baudrillard’s point was that simulation proliferated as a result of the new media like TV, but the Internet as a participatory medium carried this trend even further. 2-chan users are not just passive consumers of such signs provided by the mass media but are producing, performing, and exchanging referentless, decontexualised signs to generate a sense of belonging to a cyber community and a fantasy ‘Japan’.

The notion of a *fantasy* Japan both consumed and produced by Netto-Uyoku is not unlike @azuma_otaku:_2001's critique of otaku. Azuma argues that although the imagery *otaku* consumed and produce stems from an imitation of American pop-culture (in particular Disney animation), attempts are made to draw connections to pre-war traditions (in particular the Edo-period of 1603-1868) and portray this subculture and the media they consume as uniquely Japanese. Moreover, traditional Japanese motifs in wholly unrelated genres such as science fiction serve to reinforce an imagined *fantasy* or *pseudo*-Japan (*giji nihon*, 疑似日本). This pseudo-Japan, argues Azuma, stems from a psychological need for self reenforcement due to the loss of traditional identity after the Second World War, and again due to on-going contradictions in society reaching its peak after the narrative of economical growth collapsed in the '90s [@azuma_otaku:_2001, ch.1]. Moreover, Azuma puts right-wing ideologies in Japan in direct correlation to this *otaku* subculture, arguing that "it can be said that Japan's right-wing discourse has generally survived through processes of becoming subcultured, falsified and *otaku*-ized." (「日本の右翼的言説は一般にサブカルチャー化しフェイク化しオタク化することで生き残ってきたとも言える。」, "Nihon no uyoku-teki gensetsu wa ippan ni sabukaruchā-ka shi feiku-ka shi otaku-ka suru koto de ikinokotte kitatomo ieru.")  [@azuma__2007, p.23]. One could then read Baudrillard's notion of simulations and simulacra in this argument, stating that those Japanese motifs in Japanese sub-cultural media associated with *otaku* are exactly such examples of a referentless *real*—a mediated hyper-reality that precedes actual reality.

If there is one platform illustrating Azuma's and Sakamoto's understanding of Baudrillard's theory, it would be Niconico (*nikoniko* ニコニコ). Founded in 2006 as a video sharing service similar to YouTube, Niconico caters (as illustrated in **figure \ref{fig:nicotop}**) primarily to sub-cultural groups with a focus on Japanese animation or video-games (or what has arguably since transcended to pop-culture status). 

Niconico nevertheless contains a category with topics related to society, politics and news, and is since used for broadcasting political discussions and information on elections. Niconico has since expanded as web-portal with a dedicated online news service, Niconico News (ニコニコニュース),[^126] comics service and online dictionary. Its user base overlaps with that of 2channel and Hiroyuki Nishimura himself served as CEO for the company behind Niconico, Dwango.

\end{figure}

While functionally similar to what YouTube offers, Niconico distinguishes itself further through the ability to place time-synced, horizontally scrolling comments on top of the video playing. Niconico is therefore not just reliant on user generated content, the content itself is actively transformed by those same users. While this no doubt brings about a sense of community, it could be argued that not unlike a laugh track on prime-time sitcoms indicating comical beats, such methods creates a standardized, homogeneous reaction to particular beats in the video. In a 2013 *Japan Times* article, Journalist [@mie_xenophobia_2013] paraphrases DPJ’s then-Secretary General Azumi Jun in criticizing Abe's proposal to campaign on Nico Nico, saying that "Net uyoku often alter such videos by directly overlaying their comments on them."[^127]

\begin{figure}[!htb]

  \caption{\label{fig:murai-ratio} Breakdown of videos in (Niconico) "Politics" category.}
 \includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth,trim=4 4 4 4,clip]{images/murai-ratio2.eps}
\end{figure}

@murai_net_2012 uses Tsuji's above classification to identify videos containing Netto-Uyoku ideologies, finding 92.8% (3712/4000) of the top ranking videos in the 'Politics' category to be as such (see **figure \ref{fig:murai-ratio}** for a breakdown per topic). In his content analysis, he describes these videos as deviant from the "recreational atmosphere of the other categories", containing political messages negative towards East Asian nations, the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) and the "anti-Japanese" mass media. He goes on to claim "these conservative videos are usually filled with sympathetic comments by anonymous viewers" and that "videos to condemn imagined enemies are filled with harsh language, while scenes of 'patriotic' activities are praised as heroic." He fears that due to the mass quantity of such videos in the 'Politics' section, those political views will be perceived as the standard and have a radicalizing effect on the mostly 10s and 20s demography [@murai_net_2012, pp.369-371].



This is consistent with @anderson_imagined_2006's notion of *imagined communities*, which @sakamoto_koreans_2011 and @murai_net_2012 both draw on. Anderson coined this during his research on Nationalism and suggests that nations are not communities in a strict sense, but 'imagined' communities, implying that the sense of kinship felt between its members is a social construct based on mutual experiences and a homogeneous, mutual language derived from print capitalism and the rise of mass-media. These communities thus develop both a sense of imagined sameness as well as a clearly defined paradigm of 'otherness'. 

Mcluhan earlier argued that with the invention of print-media so then did we become part of a literate 'space-biased' culture rather than an oral 'time-biased' one, bringing about a heightened sense of individualism, capitalism and nationalism. With his idea of a 'global village', McLuhan however hypothesized that a shift towards electronic media (referring at the time primarily to radio and television) would again alter society—this time from a literate culture to a 'post-literate' visual culture. Such a visual culture would stimulates all senses and transcends time and space, leading from individualism to a collective, homogeneous identity, in which the lack of a physical body or physical cues creates a different relation to oneself and one's surroundings. (McLuhan, 1962, p. 156, McLuhan 1967:63). 

In a similar sense, social media on the Internet creates a perceived sense of affinity between its members and the social and interpersonal change of this 'imagined cyber-community' and McLuhian 'global village' can be argued to transcends that of it's nation. 

Anthropologist @appadurai_modernity_1996 argued early on that the rise of the Internet as a new 'mediascape' would lead to the creation of new, transnational and asynchronous communities, based on ideology rather than on national narratives, and diverting from traditional mass-media. Murai Shusuke (-@murai_net_2012, 375–76) argues however the opposite; precisely due Japanese Internet-users' monolingualism, not withstanding full global access through the Internet, any possibility of trans-nationality is severely limited. Within the anonymity of on-line bulletin boards such as 2channel, social markers remain thus primarily defined by language and nation-based ideology. 

###Twitter

Whereas 2channel and Niconico, despite undeniable high in usage, still have an image of subculture, Twitter has rooted itself more strongly amongst Japanese Internet users.  

@hack_subculture_2016 describes the Netto-Uyoku as "an online subculture gravitating around a core of nationalist and historical revisionist beliefs inflected with intense xenophobia," [@hack_subculture_2016, p.34]

**figure \ref{fig:murai-ratio}** illustrates this. The rhetoric used in the description of both user pages fits @tsuji_eng:_2008's classification to a tee. **Figure \ref{fig:twitter1}** usage of *Japanese subject* (*Nihon shinmin* 日本臣民) brings to mind a pre-war Japan with Japanese citizens as the subject of the Japanese Emperor. This user further expresses his support both for the LDP and the Japan First Party founded by Zaitokukai's founder Sakurai Makoto. The laws in question[^136] as well as the call for nuclear power, the visits to Yasukuni Shrine and the military aircraft Osprey[^135] are highly controversial topics and seem to be included more as a reactionary, polemic statement. **Figure \ref{fig:twitter2}** uses the normative 'Normal Japanese' construct; this users support for constitutional amendment, patriotic feelings and negative feelings towards the left-wing (*payoku*, パヨク)[^137] and three 'Tokutei' countries (*Tokua san-kakoku* 特亜三ヵ国)[^138] is normal, perhaps leaning a tad on the right (*choi migi*, チョイ右).

@higuchi__2014



In 2015, @taka_twitter_2015 held two quantitative text analyses of respectively a corpus of data containing Twitter messages pertaining to (ethnic) Koreans and one to China. Taka claims that since the 2011 earthquake, ethnic Koreans and those with out a Japanese passport residing in Japan have seen an increase in hate, libel and false rumors (*dema* デマ). Between the period of November 5, 2012 and February 16, 2013, Taka collected Korean-related tweets with a final corpus of 109,589 tweets, (which due the limitations of collecting data on Twitter cannot be claimed to be exhaustive) whereof 48,934 were retweets. Through a frequency analysis of the contents of the tweets (which he further codified into topics such as politics, historical problems, racism, 2channel, the call for dispersion, etc), Taka revealed that terms associated with socio-political tensions or hate-speech far outweigh references to Korean pop-culture. Finally, through a sentiment analysis, he found the majority of those messages (70%) to be negative. Moreover, they are dispersed by a small group of users intending these messages to be further shared. Moreover, he examined a distrust of mass media, reliance or links to 2channel and 2channel curated aggregation sites (*matome*-blogs), a belief in a "hidden truth" (*"'Shinjitsu' ga kakusa rete iru to iu shin'nen"*, 「"真実" が隠されているという信念」) and critique of anything self-identified as anti-Japanese [@taka_twitter_2015-1]. His analysis of the corpus pertaining to China (a final corpus of 67,884 Tweets collected between September 19, 2012 and November 5, 2012, whereof 25,139 were Retweets) revealed the same trends, with beliefs in truths hidden by mass media, negative sentiment that outweighs the one seen in the Korean-related corpus; most likely the effects of South Korea's soft-power [@taka_twitter_2015].

In their quantitative approach to Netto-Uyoku's usage of bots to spread political propaganda during the 2014 General Election, @schafer_japans_2017 asserts the importance of the Internet and social media in the outcome of Japan's General Election of 2014, arguing that "it was not only with the support of “assertive conservative organizations” such as *Nippon Kaigi* but also with the help of netto uyo, manipulating a huge cyber army of bots on Twitter pushing a similar nationalist agenda, that Abe was successful in the last election, " [-@schafer_japans_2017, p.4]. Furthermore, Schäfer, building on @kitada__2008's aforementioned theorization of cynicism as trait of 2channel and its associated Netto-Uyoku, argues that "political bots play an important role in this cynical online strategy of Japanese Internet right-wingers, " [-@schafer_japans_2017, p.6].

Bots, Schäfer's study, refer to "computer-generated programs that post, tweet, or message of their own accord" (-@schafer_japans_2017, p.10) in @schafer_japans_2017 collected, in a timespan of weeks before- until the day after the election, a sample of 542,584 tweets related to the election.

##The Action-Conservative Movement (ACM)



Like Yasuda Koichi, she ties *2channel* to the ACM (or rather, the "emergence of new forms of far right movement in Japan") such as the Shinshakai Undo and more specifically the Zaitokukai. Of note to her is the Zaitokukai's active use of social media for propagating ideology, hinting a radicalizing effect by claiming such media usage is how the Zaitokukai "recruit the young." 


Their usage of hate speech then, while through various interpretations of the Penal Code illegal, so argues Morris-Suzuki, goes unpunished "because such laws could limit freedom of speech." Finally she claims that, despite a lack of violence, these movements both on and offline should be taken seriously. Why? She recalls an incident in January 2001, when shortly before the planned public broadcast of an NHK documentary on wartime acts of violence against women by the Japan military, the national broadcast service NHK was forced to cut parts including testimony and preliminary findings. The reason for this, as turns out later, was an implied censorship and political interference by Abe Shinzo, unsupportive of the biased nature of the show. As the media-scape shifted, however, so too did Abe Shinzo and a number of Japanese politicians including Hashimoto Toru take "to social media with great enthusiasm."[^3] In particular, she recalls an incident in which Abe's secretary mobilized Abe's friends and followers on his Facebook page (at the time counting at respectively 4,800 and 230,000) for an online attack, again, on the NHK (including a *fake news* story of one panel member on the show). Rather than condemning this, and contradictory to his public statement of "Japan’s diplomacy must always be rooted in democracy" in 2012," Abe instead perpetuates this attack by responding to that public message on his Facebook with another *ad hominem* attack.[^61]

As both founder of the Zaitokukai and Japan First Party, and himself a quintessential Netto-Uyoku member, Makoto Sakurai is present in virtually every paper dealing with Netto-Uyoku. Yet relatively little personal information on him is publicly available (and even his actual birth-name was left unknown for several years).[^62] @yasuda_eng:_2012 spends considerable time uncovering elements of Sakurai Makoto's past, elements he himself has later repeated in an interview with the conservative right-wing newspaper @sankei_news__2016 (one of the few mainstream outlets covering his political ambitions during the 2016 Tokyo gubernatorial elections).

Sakurai (reportedly born in Fukuoka on 15-02-1972 and raised by a single mother) recalls some potentially fictitious accounts leading up to his distrust of established left-wing institutions and ethnic Korean citizens, including acts of violence by students from a nearby North-Korean affiliated high school, corruption amongst local politicians and a dislike for the Japan Teachers' Union.

Yasuda traces the start of his activism (or particularly the anti-Korean element of it, kenkan katsudō 嫌韓活動) back to the 2002 FIFA world championship organized in Seoul, South Korea. Despite immense support towards South Korea, Sakurai claims an anti-Japanese presence on the Internet, with such slogans as "Lose, Japan!" (*nihon makero* 「日本負けろ」).

##Conclusion



#Cybernationalism and Japan — Connecting the Dots

In chapter one, I have suggested that the Netto-Uyoku adhere ideologically to a form of right-wing populist nationalism (which I'll further refer to as neo-nationalism). I have further suggested that media and this form of right-populism sweeping the world are intrinsically linked. Finally, we can from the very meaning of the Japanese term Netto-Uyoku (the 'Internet Right') draw an implied importance of the Internet and social media. These loaded statements lead to several inevitable challenges. Concepts such as ideology, populism and nationalism (along with such terms as freedom and democracy) are due to their over-inflation in usage at an increasing risk of becoming neigh reduced to trending political abstractions; or to borrow from Laclau's [-@laclau_populist_2005, p.70] theorization of semiotics and political identity, empty signifiers. This chapter serves to build the theoretical framework through which I will interpret the Netto-Uyoku.

##Discourse, Power, Ideology

"1. A system of ideas and ideals, especially one which forms the basis of economic or political theory and policy. 2. The set of beliefs characteristic of a social group or individual," thus defines the online Oxford Dictionary the concept of ideology.[^36] Although Terry Eagleton in his *Ideology: An Introduction* [-@eagleton_ideology:_1991] agrees that such a pragmatic view on the notion of ideology is common in public discourse (albeit with the possibility of an underlying critique: that of the ideologue having an oversimplified view of the world, and through indoctrination has a distorted understanding of reality), he does warn, in light of the historical context briefly sketched below, against one 'Grand Global Theory' or one single comprehensive definition of ideology; especially one that would contrast ideology with 'pragmatism.'[^37] After all, following Martin Heidegger's hermeneutic reasoning of interpreting reality, it would be impossible to identify and judge an occurrence without a set of preconceived values. Or following Mannheim's Paradox, analyzing a world-view as an ideology is achieved only from the vantage point of another ideology [-@eagleton_ideology:_1991: p.1, pp221-224]. Actions of the Netto-Uyoku are, intentional or not, ideologically motivated. By studying the discourse and rhetoric of the Netto-Uyoku, we can uncover the underlying ideological mechanisms of the Netto-Uyoku, and by unearthing these processes, we can then understand how its discourse is formed. Keeping in mind Mannheim's Paradox, that this paper too is ideologically predisposed,[^50] a critical reading of the Netto-Uyoku's discourse and ideological stances could help to unravel any contradictions in, and give more insight of, greater social trends facing our world today.

###Conceptualizing ideology

Conceptualization of ideology has known many approaches. Historically, the concept finds its roots in the French Revolution as a positivist attempt to develop a new scientific framework of Enlightenment ideas ('the discourse of patterns'), a form of skeptical scientific materialism [@eagleton_ideology:_1991: p.70]. Following Napoleon's attack of the French "ideologues" as, in @mudde_oxford_2013 (**Page number**)'s words, "unrealistic escapism and philosophical reverie," ideology has since gone through several shifts in meaning. From a classical Marxist view, as interpreted by @eagleton_ideology:_1991, ideology too represented a false or misleading awareness of the human situation. Ideology was however to be understood as an instrument of those in control of the means of production. That is to say, steering—whether intentional or not—the economically subservient class away from a scientific, objective reality (and hence from what is in the best interests of the dominated class) with a *false consciousness*, of one's ability to self-identify as an economic class and express a political will. Hence maintaining the equilibrium this mode of production.[^3] In other words, classical Marx' materialist theory places ideology as a superstructure in contrast to reality within an economic, dialectic basis-superstructure relationship. The dominant ideology is tied directly to the base, the mode of production, and visa-versa. On the precondition of being universally applicable, we might then, for example, view the *kokutai* (国体) notion or state-Shintoism to be ideological means for morally *justifying* exploitation (perhaps viewing the *zaibatsu* conglomerate as part of a Japanese *bourgeoisie*),[^54] while in contrast during the era of the 'Economic Miracle', the ideologies of economic growth and the *nihonjinron* (日本人論) breed of ethnocentric nationalism would then function to deprive of or obscure from the subservient class the objective reality; thus maintaining or legitimizing the *status quo* of society and its economic structures of exploitation. We see this line of reasoning in the Alt-Right and Netto-Uyoku-appropriated conspiracy theories of "red-pilling" and "waking up" (*kakusei* 覚醒 or *mesameru* 目覚める, a concept Furuya Tsunehiro has referred to as a matrix-historical viewpoint, *matorikksu-shikan* 「マトリックス史観」). This is a reference to the main character of 1999 science fiction film The Matrix who after consuming a red pill wakes up to a reality in which humanity is enslaved as a source of energy for a large machine. The idea of 'waking up' or being red-pilled is becoming aware of a Marxist left-wing elite utilizing their cultural hegemony over media to brainwash and exploit the ordinary people into believing a fabricated world-view. This very notion is of course unapologetic Marxist in nature. 

This line of thinking is nevertheless too economically determinist. Furthermore, failure of Marx' proposed collapse of capitalist society betrays its rigid scientism. after all, despite hints of a Taisho-era democracy we cannot pinpoint an exact bourgeois revolution within the transition from feudalism to capitalism in Japan. Karl Mannheim then approached ideology as dynamic and being shaped both by the unconscious assumptions guiding our lives on a *psychological* level, and by our (social group's) position within social structures, on a *social* level. For him, this Marxist interpretation of history *itself* was an ideology; so too changed the pejorative notion of ideology and grew the idea of a 'positive' ideology to counter class oppression [@van_dijk_politics_2006;@mudde_oxford_2013: ch.1,ch.3]. Since the early writings on ideology, and with sociological developments such as the *linguistic turn*, ideology as a concept has seen a wide range of meanings, deeply entangled with the study of discourse, culture and politics [@mudde_oxford_2013: ch.1], with contributions made by amongst others Marxist scholars Louis Althusser, Georg Lukács (*theory of reification*) and Antonio Gramsci (*theory of hegemony*), as well as Michel Foucault and members of the Frankfurt School. Contributions that have helped develop the relation between the Marxist notion of ideology and the fields of culture and communication. In his approach to ideology critique, Eagleton recapitulates top down from its most common to its most specific usage, in six points the different epistemological perspectives on ideology [@eagleton_ideology:_1991, pp.28-30; @fuchs_racism_2018, pp.158-159]. let us then observe the following list:

1. Ideology as the "the general material processes of production of ideas, beliefs, and values in social life" and "the whole complex of signifying practices and symbolic processes in a particular society" [@eagleton_ideology:_1991, p28]. In other words, a neutral, descriptive definition of ideology as *culture*.
2. Ideology as the "ideas and beliefs" of a "specific, socially significant group or class" as "a kind of collective symbolic self-expression" [@eagleton_ideology:_1991, p29]. In other words, ideology as a neutral *world-view*.
3. Ideology as the "promotion and legitimation of particular interests [...] in the face of opposing interests" and as rhetorical discourse, a "discursive field in which self-promoting social powers conflict and collide over questions central to the reproduction of social power as a whole" [@eagleton_ideology:_1991, p29]. In this definition, ideology begins to be seen in relational, conflictive terms.
4. Like 3, the "promotion and legitimation of sectoral interests" but by "a dominant social power." This perhaps in order to "*unify* a social formation in ways convenient for its rulers [...] securing the complicity of subordinated classes and groups" [@eagleton_ideology:_1991, pp29-30]. This definition refines the third definition
5. Like 4, "ideas and beliefs which help to legitimate interests of a ruling group or class" but specifically through "distortion and dissimulation" [@eagleton_ideology:_1991, p30].
6. False or deceptive beliefs "arising not from the interests of a dominant class but from the material structure of society as a whole" [@eagleton_ideology:_1991, p30], such as Marx's theory of commodity fetishism. The economic base determines the superstructure of ideology.

### Gramsci, Lukács & Althusser (Post-War Japan & The Economic Miracle)

The epistemologically neutral definitions we have seen courtesy of the Oxford Dictionary fit in the first two descriptions given above, while the last three are akin the Marxist tradition; the last one in particular relating to so-called *vulgar* or economically reductionist Marxism. In these, power is a zero-sum game. The dominant possession of power invariably reduces the power of the subservient class. With that in mind, and for importance to this thesis, are the next generation of Marxists: Gramsci, Lukács and Althusser—three crucial thinkers in expanding Marxist theory on ideology. Building on Marx' concept of false consciousness, Lukács theorized class consciousness as a class-bound ideology obtained through class-level self-awareness, the result of *reification*. *Reification* meaning the alienation of the self and a fragmented understanding of the totality, in the wake of Marx's notion of commodity fetishism and commodification of labor [@eagleton_ideology:_1991, pp.94-99]. 

After a failed communist uprising in Italy and in order to explain the failure of Marx' conception of the inevitable proletarian revolution, Gramsci recognized culture (or cultural *soft* power) as an important factor not sufficiently taken in account for in traditional Marxist theory. Gramsci views the state as a superstructure consisting of a *political society* and a *civil society*—in other words, an *integral state* in which the latter is an essential component for maintaining consent and the former is a means to coerce and discipline those who don't consent.[^52] Furthermore, Gramsci coins the notion of *cultural hegemony*, arguing that consent to the rule of the governing class is a manufactured outcome of socialization and promulgation of ideology.[^48] More specifically, promulgation through social institutions within the public sphere of civil society: education, organized religion, the media industry, and the entertainment industry. While the civil society is in modern capitalist nations formally not under control of the political society (notwithstanding that Japan is ranked 67th in the 2019 World Press Freedom Index),[^44] they serve to impose the state's dominant set of values as "common sense": the values of the dominant class become accepted as that of society in general. Predominance of the ruling class by coercion is in contrast restricted to the level of political society, which includes institutions as the government, police, judicial system and army. In a modern capitalist state however, civil society and *soft* power have grown to such an extent that this "legitimized violence" has to certain degrees answer to public consent; which again can be achieved through the dominant ideology. Yet, if contradictions in the dominant ideology are too great, the manufacturing of consent becomes unsustainable. In other words, this leads to a *hegemonic crisis*. 

For Althusser, ideology was an *unconscious*, discursive and material process; assimilated and reproduced through cultural practices in the ideological state apparatus; with little space for human agency. Gramsci does however see room for this in civil society. For Gramsci, ideology does have value. He further coins the concept of *subaltern* (a term crucial in post-colonial studies)[^40] to refer not just to those lacking in economic and political power (such as peasants and the proletariat), but those whose very cultural or social identity is on the fringes of the dominant ideology. Those whose history is overshadowed by that of the ruling class and who are denied the right to make one's own culture and historical narratives. Yet in these fringes is an opening to develop a subaltern consciousness, a *sub-culture*. For revolution to be successful, it is therefore first necessary for those groups to dismantle the cultural hegemony by developing one's own organic ideology (a dialectic process of an "ideological struggle" with the hegemonic ideologies) unifying a 'collective will' as class-consciousness and producing a counter-hegemony. Only after ascertaining a counter-hegemonic dominance on civil society could the subservient classes succeed in coercive action over the political society [@gramsci_selections_1985: p.47, pp.210-238].[^41] Gramsci calls this *passive revolution* [@gramsci_selections_1985, pp106-120]. In the case of a crisis of hegemony as mentioned above, the dominant class has no means but to either rely on coercion through the political society, or to consolidate oppositional movements in civil society (the passive revolution). Ideology for Gramsci is a specific historical phenomenon (a "historicist" approach in contrast to "scientific" Marxism) and observable both on a micro- and macro-scale. On an individual level, ideology is a "lived, habitual social practice ... the unconscious, inarticulate dimensions of social experience"; on a collective level it is that of social institutions [@eagleton_ideology:_1991, p115]. Perry Anderson[^43] builds on this. Whereas Gramsci locates cultural hegemony in civil society alone, Anderson finds hegemony in political society, "for the political form of the capitalist state is itself a vital organ of such power," and reasons that the institutions of civil society play a complementary role to hegemony [@eagleton_ideology:_1991, pp.112-113].[^42] 

Some concrete examples of this reasoning. If orthodox Marxism were to view the contradictory nature of increasing student debt in the United Stages and the ideological narratives of neo-liberal capitalism[^51] as a trigger for working class awareness and the inevitable overthrow of capitalism, then in Gramsci's interpretation, civil society would be the stage for counter-hegemonic processes in passive revolution. 2011 saw widespread resentment directed at Wall Street in the populist Occupy Wall Street, with ideological slogans as "We are the 99%" [@rehmann_bernie_2016]. In 2019, politicians Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are running on a counter-hegemonic platform to cancel student debt. Likewise, although the democratic impact of the 1994 electoral system reforms in Japan is questionable considering the near constant dominance of the Liberal Democrat Party on national politics since [@komatsu_first_2017], the 1993 Japanese general election and fall of the 1955 system[^53] could also be read through this lens. When Japan, as elsewhere, entered a late-capitalist phase of mass consumerism, different contradictions arose. Although not explicitly referring to Gramsci or Marxist traditions of ideology, the language of @dower_peace_1993 in his narrative assessment of the New Left and late '60 political movements certainly seem to suggest such logic as well. As Dower states, the growth of Japan as a cultural and economic powerhouse brought to light contradictions in society—the *San Francisco System*, the ambiguous position of Okinawa and environmental issues (mercury poisoning in Minamata) to name a few; pitting "liberal and left-wing critics against the dominant conservative elites" and introducing "a more radical anti-imperialist critique to the discourse on peace and democracy." In light of rapid economic growth, hegemonic ideologies of nationalism, capitalism, peace and democracy retained a strong grip on public consent, or as @dower_peace_1993 puts it, the "conservative hegemony-the bedrock of the 1955 System-continued to rule japan" [@dower_peace_1993, pp.5-6,p.21]. Nevertheless this counter-hegemonic shakes society in the late '60s.

>"It is estimated that between 1967 and 1970 alone, more than eighteen million Japanese took to the streets to protest the war in Vietnam and demand the reversion of Okinawa to Japan. Uncounted others were involved in the university struggles and citizens' movements against the ravages of the growth-oriented state. As elsewhere, "people's power" entered the Japanese lexicon at this time as a legitimate and essential alternative to bourgeois parliamentary politics; and, as elsewhere, the theory and practice of "people's power" ranged from peaceful protest to wanton violence. By the mid-1970s the nationwide people's movement was moribund, but it left as legacies the memory and experience of grass-roots mobilization that could be evoked in more particularistic causes thereafter." [@dower_peace_1993, p.22]

This was a period of hegemonic crisis, but one that in its aftermath did leave a considerably sour aftertaste in the mouths of many. Communists groups associated with New Left thought, such as the Japanese Red Army and the East Asia Anti-Japan Armed Front, proceeded directly to direct action and vise-versa so did the political society too respond with violence. Furthermore, in light of economic growth and relative public wealth, the hegemonic ideologies of economic and ethnic nationalism (what @dower_peace_1993 coins a "late-Showa cult of exceptionalism" [-@dower_peace_1993, p.6]) had despite high profile political scandals as the Lockheed bribery thus far helped retain a strong, manufactured grip on consent. Nevertheless, with the collapse of the bubble economy so too did contradictions in the dominant, hegemonic ideology once again become unearthed (Akio Morita and Shintaro Ishihara's 1989 essay *The Japan That Can Say No* has not aged particularly well), renewing distrust in established politics and the political system behind it. In other words, the political reform of the 1955 System by temporarily allied political outsiders in 1994 was the logical outcome of an increased alienated Japanese civil society. 

###The Frankfurt School & Post-Ideology (The Lost Decades)

The Frankfurt School of Critical Theory furthers the theoretical approach to how culture shapes ideology. In particular, Adorno and Horkheimer's Dialectic of Enlightenment

Habermas: public sphere

Adorno: the culture industy


This line of reasoning is in itself of course highly ideological and if any of this sounds unapologetically populist, that is no coincidence. I consider this logic an important tactic of what I call *digital populists*, populists focusing on cultural-ideological warfare on the Internet and whose rhetoric is shaped by sub-cultures online. I maintain that this Gramscian understanding of ideology and hegemony is beneficial in understanding the processes of reasoning behind populist, neo-nationalist (and ultimately, 'cyber-nationalist') ideology. Moreover, the open and public nature of the Internet and social media would present an ideal public space for the under-represented to form a cultural identity and engage in ideological struggle with the hegemonic dominant ideology. The rise of online *influencers* using social media such as YouTube, Niconico, Twitter, Instagram and Facebook to spread politically inspired messages, and right-wing populists utilizing this medium to sell a narrative of revolution, certainly seem to suggest so. Furthermore, As I will expand on in the next chapter, its very creation is commonly framed as being rooted in the American libertarian counter-culture movement of the sixties, after all. 

The debate on ideology far from stopped since. Francis Fukuyama, for example, claimed in his essay *The End of History?* that we have reached a post-ideological world in which western liberal democracy was the end-point of ideological evolution, an idea that could not be improved upon. On the other side, and furthering Lukács' ideas on alienation due to the increased importance of commodity fetishism in capitalist society, Žižek views late-capitalist cynicism as inherent to modern-day ideology, summarized best as "they know very well what they are doing, but still, they are doing it." We are aware of the contradictions, of the false consciousness, but we renounce it only in cynical subversion [-@zizek_mapping_2012, p.18, pp312-5].


##Neo-Nationalism

Can we then interpret this world-wide growth of neo-nationalist movements as counter-hegemonic process? 

###Populism

How then are we to understand populism? Open just about any recent article on politicians such as Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders, Viktor Orbán, Corbyn, Jair Bolsenaro or Matteo Salvini and the possibility is high any of them will have been name-called a populist, disregarding any dissimilarities in either political agenda or geographical situation. Often used in a pejorative fashion, there is however little explanation if any at all offered in those takes, and with an unprecedented soar in the frequency of usage of this term in Western discourse (a Google Trends search for populism both worldwide and in Japan over the past 10 years, as illustrated on **figure \ref{fig:populism-gt}**, reveal a worldwide rise of public interest in populism correlating to the political shifts referred to earlier),[^35] the term populist is increasingly used interchangeable or combined with demagoguery.[^28]

###The Medium is the Message

Despite some cultural lag, there are now many theoretical options to approaching the Internet, new media, and politics. In an early stage, Rimmer and Morris-Suzuki (1999), following sociologists Kumon Shumpei and Masuda Yoneji's writings on a 'teledemocracy', take a utopian view and predicted the Internet would serve democracy by fundamentally altering its users thinking patterns and leading to a power-shift away from mass-media. Recent debate on the Internet's role in populist politics in East-Asia (Youngmi Kim 2009, Azuma Hiroki 2011, Tamura en Kobayashi 2014) have instead taken a distinct dystopian turn, employing such terms as 'the People's Will 2.0', and again arguing that due to the very nature of computer-mediated communication and social media, with traits such as anonymity, filter-bubbles and so-called 'echo-chambers', the individual 'will' has been reduced to a general 'will' led by emotion rather than rationality. Thus, following this logic, Internet as an open medium for communication would become an invaluable tool for political leaders utilizing a populist narrative.


Paradigm shift: postmodernist fragmentation due inhibiting the linear reading exerpience

###Japanese Internet

The development of the Internet in Japan has a similar history as in the United States and Europe, starting with universities developing technology to interlink academic papers. As the "first nationwide noncommercial computer network" in 1984, JUNET (Japan University/UnixNETwork) linked Tokyo University, Keio University and the Tokyo Institute of Technology [@aoki_virtual_1994]. According to @barubora_eng:_2017, the loosening grip of government policy in 1985 led to the consequent adaptation of bulletin board systems (BBS) for computer-mediated communication between hobbyists in Japan. Through translations in technological magazines,[^15] the ideology of American west coast voices crucial to the rise of Silicon Valley becomes known in Japan as *shisō nishikaigan shisō* 西海岸思想 or *Karuforunia shisō* カリフォルニア思想 (West Coast Thought or California Thought): an ideology that envisions increased participation in democracy through the development of IT and computer science. In his narrative on the development of computers and the Internet, John Markoff echoes this connection of the libertarian hackers-ethos to '60s counterculture [-@markoff_what_2005]. @barubora_eng:_2017 argue that while, as Markoff too states, early rhetoric on the Internet in the united states is built on newsgroups discussing political activities and usages of the medium,[^132] in contrast were Japanese mailing lists and BBS then primarily built around niche sub-culture topics [-@barubora_eng:_2017, ch.1]. @aoki_virtual_1994 too argues that early adaption was associated with *otaku* (*otaku-zoku*, オタク族, a term that roughly in this timespan came to denote those with obsessive interests in sub-culture topics) and less accessible to the public due to the difficulty of encoding Japanese characters on the Internet; early communication had to be written with the Latin script.[^102]

[@azuma_otaku:_2001] has argued the same, claiming that from the beginning of computer mediated communication (CMC) in Japan in the '80s onwards, the discourse on Japanese internet has been shaped by *otaku*; not just through websites and bulletin boards through references to Japanese animation or video-games dispersed on a technical level as well (such as in the naming of FTP-sites or sample sentences in manuals for word or spreadsheet software) [-@azuma_otaku:_2001, p.4]

##Conclusion

This paper takes a critical approach to ideology, basing itself primarily on the work of Gramsci and thinkers aligned with the Frankfurt School of critical theory. Thus in this paper I view ideology as a world-view rooted in class-conflict; and in capitalist nations that rely on consent over coercion, as a means to consolidate power. Consolidating power over civil society as done by those in control of the political society (the 'elite' or establishment) through disseminating ideology (by means of popular culture and mainstream media: the hegemonic ideology). Contradictions in society, a consequence of the capitalist nature of commodity fetishism, lead to alienation among exploited classes and therefore to class-awareness and an opening for counter-hegemonic processes in civil society. This reasoning is a strong element of populist rhetoric and neo-nationalists. I adhere to @mudde_oxford_2013's definition of populism as a thin-centered ideology based on the antagonizing of an 'elite' in function of a homogeneous 'will' of 'the people'. Right-wing populists view the 'elite' in this case as primarily a left-wing entity utilizing the media to spread manufactured consent through a *fake* world-view. In this narrative the populists *are* the counter-hegemonic forces. They utilize alternative means in civil-society to appeal to 'the people', the exploited classes that are more often than not defined based on nationalist ideologies: ethnic background or cultural values (i.e. Judeo-christian values). This *fake* world-view borders on a nativist conspiracy theory wherein globalist values of the elite lead to clashes of culture and the disintegration of 'the people's' best interest.

What the French fachosphère, the Japanese Netto-Uyoku and the American Alt-Right have in common is exactly that: a neo-nationalist ideology of populism, nationalism and nativism. I argue however a difference between those that adhere to this ideology and utilize the Internet purely for organizational means (ie. protest marches), and *netizens* as a sub-culture adhering to an ideology of Internet as a 'new frontier'

 For them, however, the Internet forms an escape in the form of a 'new frontier'; one that ought to be free from elite interference. With some violent exceptions, there is a difference between 

 In other words, what I have defined as cyber-nationalism.

If self-perceived contradictions in society (such as immigration and terrorism) brought about a wave of right-wing populism with 2016 as a pivotal year, then 2009 - 2011 could be considered the same for Japan. Blatantly populist politicians as Shintaro Ishihara and Hashimoto Toru gain renewed fame, 




#The Anatomy of Japanese Cyber-Nationalism ー From 2channel to Wikipedia

I illustrated in the second chapter that Netto-Uyoku are often associated particularly with 2channel, Niconico and with its more recent rise of usage in Japan, with Twitter as well [@katayama_2-channel_2007;@tsuji_eng:_2008;@sakamoto_koreans_2011;@murai_net_2012;@yasuda_eng:_2012;@morris-suzuki_freedom_2013;@taka_twitter_2015-1]. Furthermore, all of these belong to the top visited websites in Japan, with the latter two dominantly fixed in the top ten.[^97] In the previous chapter I have also brought up McLuhan's argument that the content of the message is itself intrinsically shaped by the vessel through which it is delivered. Following this argument through in the age of online social media, Lev Manovich argues that software now takes a central position in our interaction with the world around us [-@manovich_software_2013]. As someone creates a potentially viral image intended for political persuasion and posts it online, they might do so using their laptop computer to edit different layers of the image through image-editing software as Photoshop. Next they might use Chrome as a browser to interpret and visualize the semantic text of the World Wide Web (HTML), and upload the image on a platform as Twitter or 2channel. They have to adhere to the limits required on image-size and length of text, and preferably add symbols for interconnection or recognition to gain a wider reach (using hash-tags, the \@ sign, or *trip-code* identifiers on pseudo-anonymous Bulletin Board Systems). Combined, these are a great amount of different interfaces for communication. @azuma_otaku:_2001 expresses similar reasoning. Whereas the content of other media has one final represented form, data on the World Wide Web is determined by software. A web-page built using the HTML syntax will represent the contents in a different fashion depending on the software and hardware it is opened with, and reveals the underlying structural composition when opened with a text-editor instead of a browser. Furthermore, similar to the non-linear structure of games, non-linear paths are an intrinsic element of the world wide web's hyper-connectedness [-@azuma_otaku:_2001, ch.3].

Since the effective start in the mid 2000s of what Tim O'Reilly coined the *Web 2.0*—a participatory web based on interactive collaboration and user-generated content—as well as the onset of machine learning and artificial intelligence in generating semantically interlinked content, over a decade has passed for social media and its hyper-extended *hyper-connectedness* to mature within our lives. Based on my theoretical framework in the previous chapter, I approach this chapter through a mixed methods critical content analysis applied to social media, attempting to bring to light from a semiotic perspective how the Netto-Uyoku reinforce and disperse ideological narratives on the Internet. While it is hard to ignore major platforms as YouTube, Twitter and 2channel, I will focus particularly on two less-documented forms of Internet-based media in Japan: *2channel*-based *matome* curated aggregation websites and Wikipedia. The former as a a means to disperse to a greater audience a selected sample of certain sub-categories as supposedly representative of the Internet *vox populi*. The latter, an open and collaborative encyclopedia built on hyper-links, is both a prime example of Azumi's non-linear and endless structure inherent to the world wide web and, more concretely, gives us through its revision history insights in how and by whom persuasive narratives are formed. 

##2channel & *Matome*-blogs

Although I cannot dismiss previous literature in tracing the *Netto-Uyoku* and their rhetorical methods back to 2channel,[^31] it would be unwise to dismiss those platforms in their whole as one homogeneous, even toxic community (with at their peak millions of messages per day).[^101] The technical base behind 2channel was created in 1999 based on the structure of early Usenet-inspired Bulletin Board Systems *ayashī wārudo* あやしいわーるど (1996, lit. 'Strange World') and *amezō rinku* あめぞうリンク (1997), purposed as a text-only multi-threaded anonymous messaging board [-@barubora_eng:_2017, ch.2]. These were subsequently the origin for the more graphically-oriented *Futaba Channel*, the software base on which *4chan* is based on. While correctly identified as strictly anonymous, users have the option to register a personal identifier (a trip-code). Moreover, messages (*posts*) have a numeral ID used when reacting to another post, and within one *thread* (a conversation on one particular topic) users often have a fixed ID to keep some consistency in communication. A thread has a limit of 1000 posts before it is 'archived' (meaning no new reactions can be placed) and users need to create a follow-up thread. Similar to the structure of news websites, those approximately 800 boards are thematically divided (including such topics as news, society, sports, idols and video-games). A 2channel ranking-site (based on the amount of threads and replies within a certain timespan)[^115] consistently places boards belonging to the news section on top, as well as several boards dedicated to idol culture.

One trend that accompanied the growth of 2channel is the appearance of so-called *matome*-sites. Those are curated aggregation websites based around particularly popular (*viral*) threads on 2channel (and since the early 2010s other social media platforms such as Twitter). The curator manually collects the material s/he deems most relevant to the viral topic in question—either as representation of public opinion, or for its comical value—and is usually accompanied with a particularly appealing title (what is in English colloquially known as 'clickbait') and a short personal comment. A common trait of those *matome*-sites is the usage of private advertising or services such as Google's Adsense for the pursuit of financial profit,[^103] and one of the larger subsections (boards) of 2channel, *Nyūsu sokuhō (kenmō)* ニュース速報 (嫌儲)[^110] started in protest of such curated aggregation sites and may by terms of service not be aggregated.

 \caption{ASCII Art (AA) parodying Netto-Uyoku}\label{fig:aa}
\end{figure}

In a July 15, 2019 thread on this board, users discuss if and why there are less expressions of Netto-Uyoku discourse on *kenmō*. There is no consistent political ideology amongst its users (who refer to themselves as *kenmomen* ケンモメン or 嫌儲民), but in an interesting group dynamic there is a perception of the other *nyūsu sokuhō* boards as their cultural Other, with an overall resistance to profit-seeking aggregation sites and writers targeting the medium they identify with.[^112] Through somewhat serious discussion on nationalism and ideology (along an occasional conspiracy theory),[^113] several users echo the 2011 earthquake as a trigger for psychological cravings for positive nationalist self-reinforcement and view *matome* blogs as one such tool. Conclusively, these *kenmomen* dislike profit-seeking *matome* blogs and marketers, therefore they reason they have not become *Netto-Uyoku* themselves (which are often subject to parody, as illustrated on **figure \ref{fig:anti-aa}**).[^114] One anonymous user summarizes their answer to the thread's question as follows [@5ch.net_eng._2019]: 

>「右翼とか左翼以前に世の中の天邪鬼なのがネットの主流だから\newline
ネトウヨがまだ頭が良いと思われていた頃はテレビや世間が左寄り\newline
今はテレビや世間がネトウヨやっているから俺たちが左寄りでバランスを取らないといけない\newline
って言う潜在意識があるんだよ」 

>"*Uyoku toka sayoku izen ni yononaka no amanojakuna no ga netto no shuryūdakara\newline neto-uyo ga mada atamagaii to omowa rete ita koro wa terebi ya seken ga hidariyori\newline ima wa terebi ya seken ga neto-uyo yatte irukara oretachi ga hidariyori de baransu o toranaito ikenai\newline tte iu senzai ishiki ga arunda yo*"

>"It's because since before all of this left-wing or right-wing talk, the voice of the Internet was this world's contrarian. When the Netto-Uyoku were still considered to be intelligent, television, public opinion and such were still left-leaning. Since they have become Netto-Uyoku themselves, we have to create a counter-balance to the left. At least there is such kind of subconscious reasoning."

Of note is the implicit ideological reasoning of the Internet as the 'new frontier' and public sphere.[^111] When this user refers to public opinion being Netto-Uyoku, it refers to the idea that the Netto-Uyoku counter-ideology has successfully spread over civil society and become the hegemonic ideology. In their reasoning, these users present a counter-balance. Or as one user claims, "the ideology of the *kenmomen* will, maybe after around two years or so, have without a doubt become the Net-mainstream" (「多分2年後くらいは嫌儲思想がネットの主流に間違いなくなっている」 *"tabun 2-nen-go kurai wa kenmō shisō ga netto no shuryū ni machigainaku natte iru"*).

I found one recent thread particularly suitable for demonstrating the reach of *matome* sites. On July 8, 2019 a South Korean YouTube *vlogger* posted a video complaining about the rising nationalist trade conflicts between South Korea. In the wake of public protests and various boycotts against Japanese products in South Korea, he tore up his airplane ticket for a planned trip to Japan and stated there are other places in the world to visit [@daelyugnamtv_eng._2019]. On July 11, 2019 4:40 P.M. an aggregation website called Record China (*rekōdochaina*, レコードチャイナ), claiming to offer information of Chinese events towards a Japanese audience, published an article on this video [@kitada_eng._2019].[^117] In this unsourced article, the author claimed that this video went viral on the Chinese video-service Pear Video (梨視頻):[^118]

>この動画は11日午前現在、16万回余り再生されている。コメント欄では、「かっこいい」「応援する」「愛国心に拍手」「日本旅行に行かないことが日本にとって一番のダメージになる」など、男性を支持するものが大半となっている。

>"Kono dōga wa 11-nichi gozen genzai, 16 man-kai-amari saisei sareteiru. Komento-ran de wa, 'kakkoī''ōen suru' 'aikokushin ni hakushu' 'Nihonryokō ni ikanai koto ga nihon ni totte ichiban no damēji ni naru' nado, dansei o shiji suru mono ga taihan to natte iru."

>As of the \nth{11} in the morning this video has been played over 160,000 times. In the comments section most of them support him, writing comments such as "cool," "I support you," "applause to patriotism," and "not traveling to Japan is the most damaging thing to Japan."

One hour after, on July 11, 2019 5:41 P.M. a user created a thread on one of 2channel's 'breaking news' sections to discuss this story [@5ch.net_eng._2019]. Based on a script I wrote to scrape the contents of this thread, I found that including the original post, within two hours 650 unique users reached 1000 messages (whereof 21 users were registered with a user-name). Out of those 1000 posts, 312 messages where then placed by 171 unique users as reaction to others (indicating the echo-chamber function for the majority of users).[^119] From there, various *matome* aggregation websites picked up on this story, starting with on July 11, 2019 7:04 P.M. the conservative 2channel news-aggregation blog *hoshu sokuhō* 保守速報 ('Conservative Newsflash'). 

Another conservative 2channel aggregation site, Anonymous Post,[^120] shared this with an addition in the post's title: "the Internet reacts 'nah, if you've paid then it's already settled, right?w' 'paying and not coming... You're the best'" (*Netto no han'nō 'iya kane haratteru ijō kōnyū-zumidaro w' 'kane haratte konai… omae saikō'* ネットの反応「いや金払ってる以上購入済みだろw」「金払って来ない… オマエ最高」) [@anonymous_post_eng._2019]. Although not indicating where this populist notion of the people's 'Internet reaction' came from, a quick comparison traced every listed 'Internet reaction' back to the 2channel thread in question. This story was subsequently shared on their Twitter-account with over 135,000 followers. At midnight, july 12, 2019 1:30 A.M. another aggregation site focusing primarily on video-games and animation (*Hachima Kiko* はちま起稿) picked up on this story. On 2019-07-15 pop-culture news-blog SoraNews24 posts an English version of this story sourcing Hachima Kiko, which was subsequently shared on online newspaper Japan Today, as well on its Japan Today's Facebook (which has as of writing over 1,3 million followers)[^107] and finally reached 4chan's /pol/ board. 

SoraNews24 and Japan Today failed to include any of the socio-political context presented in the video. Moreover it contained false claims that the South Korean YouTube vlogger "had driven all the way down to the airport to purchase a flight ticket to Japan worth 1.35 million won ($1,150)" and that "he could potentially walk up to a counter for a ticket refund," while in fact the vlogger had purchased this ticket prior to the political tensions. Although Hachima Kiko did not list the former information, it explicitly mentions the YouTube vlogger's claim that canceling the ticket and hotel is impossible [@hachima_kiko_eng:_2019;@japan_today_popular_2019]. The YouTube video has as of July 17, 2019 reached over 316,000 views, and its comment section, with over 10,000 comments, has seen an influx of English and Japanese reactions.[^121] Disregarding the actual contents of this video, in just one week did a story magnified by echo-chambers of one particular sub-community on 2channel find its way to a common media-platform presenting English news on Japan—echoing the distorted bias the story had gained in this process. 

Moreover, one of those *matome* sites listed above, Hoshu Sokuhō, was linked to on November 24, 2014 in a since removed message on Prime Minister Abe Shinzō's Facebook and Twitter account. Earlier, that *matome* site had been sued by the ethnic Korean freelance writer Lee Sinhae for libel [@the_huffington_post_jp_lee_2014;@j-cast_news_eng:_2014].[^104] The repercussions of the lawsuit have led to *hoshu sokuhō* support by other popular *matome* blogs and the withdrawal of *hoshu sokuhō*'s sponsors and Google Adsense Support, as illustrated on **figure \ref{fig:matome-examples}**.[^105]

Disregarding the content of the aggregated items in **figure \ref{fig:matome-examples}** (it should by now not be particularly surprising that most items are related to Korean topics or left-wing politics, often accompanied with the rhetorical device of '*w*'s for intended ridicule), two other things are of note. On **figure \ref{fig:moeruasia}**, *Moeruasia* uses the ethnic slur *chon* チョン as well as *hibyō* / *hwabyeong* (火病, a term referring to a culture-bound mental illness). In the wake of this trial, such *matome* blogs have out precaution since opted to exclude messages with explicit racial hatred from their aggregated posts.

>[Tragic *Chon* News] Lee Sinhae was completely refuted by the sound reasoning of Hoshu Sokuho's lawyer; falls into mental illness and breaks down in tears *wwwwwwwwww*

The second point of note is on the screenshot of *hoshu sokuhō* (see **figure \ref{fig:hoshusokuho}**). As of July, 15 2019 *hoshu sokuhō* is still in search of adverts. Whereas this blog had previously been supported by ads of large companies as Epson [@hatachi__2018], only one advertisement is filled out (with a reference to a small-scale web-comic). To the left is an advertisement for an unofficial fan-blog of Toranomon News (*toranomon nyūsu*, 虎ノ門ニュース). Although there is no substantial link between *hoshu sokuhō* and Toranomon News aside from a mutual target audience, I find that as a conservative web-show drawing up to a combined half a million viewers within its first day on YouTube and Niconico, Toranomon News is worth briefly expanding upon for both its eclectic cast of ultra-right conservative regular speakers as well as for its plethora of guest speakers (see **figure \ref{fig:toranomon}**).

The majority of those hosts, including Kent Gilbert and the Chinese born Seki Hei  (Shi Ping), have previously capitalized and continue to do so on a print-medium market for historical revisionist and nationalist 'Japan as Number One' literature and literature highly critical of China and South Korea.[^25] Since 2015 they have joined hands to influence public opinion and target the market for nationalist rhetoric online, with YouTuber and imperial descendant Takeda Tsuneyasu on the panel and YouTuber Kazuya as frequent guest (the latter seen amongst the top Niconico videos back in chapter two in **figure \ref{fig:nicotop}**). Other guests include Abe Shinzō himself,[^39] as well as former Minister of Internal Affairs and Communications Yoshitaka Shindō, various LDP lawmakers including Mio Sugita, *Nippon Kaigi* associate Sakurai Yoshiko and former idol Chiba Reiko.

\end{figure}

Hyakuta Naoki, regular commentator on Toranomon News and author of the best-selling 2006 war drama "The Eternal Zero" (which in its 2013 screen-adaption won the Japan Academy Prize for best film) went on to co-author 『日本よ、世界の真ん中で咲き誇れ』 (*nihon yo, sekai no man'naka de sakihokore*, "Japan! Be Proud of Yourself in the Center of the World!") with Abe Shinzō in 2013 and was appointed by the latter as board of governor member of Japan's national broadcast service NHK in 2013.[^56] Although his November 2018 bestseller *Nihon Kokuki* (日本国紀, 'Chronicle of Japan') was criticized for historical revisionism and plagiarism from Wikipedia [@yamamoto__2018], he subsequently followed up with the March 2019 『今こそ、韓国に謝ろう ～そして、「さらば」と言おう～』 (*Ima koso, Kankoku ni ayamarō ~ soshite,'saraba' to iō ~*, "Then let us now apologize to Korea-and say, 'Farewell'").

Takeda Tsuneyasu is not without controversy either, posting, for example, the following Tweet on May 22, 2016, enforcing stereotypes of violent crimes linked to foreigners [@takeda_eng._2016]:

>「小金井ライブハウス殺人未遂事件で逮捕された人物は「自称・岩埼友宏容疑者」と報道されている。自称ということは本名でないということ。なぜ本名で報道しない？ここが日本のメディアのおかしいところ。臆する必要はない。本名で報道すべき。これは私の憶測だが、容疑者は日本国籍ではないと思われる。」

>"*Koganei raibuhausu satsujin misui jiken de taiho sa reta jinbutsu wa `jishō iwa saiyū Hiroshi yōgi-sha' to hōdō sa rete iru. Jishō to iu koto wa honmyōdenai to iu koto. Naze honmyō de hōdō shinai?

>"The person arrested for the Koganei Live House murder attempt is reported as the 'self-proclaimed' Tomohiro Iwasaki. 'Self-proclaimed' means it is not a real name. Why not report their real name? This is strange of the Japanese media. There is no need to be hesitant. The media should report it under their real name. This is my speculation, but the suspect seems not to be of Japanese nationality."

Some have embraced the Netto-Uyoku phrasing, such as YouTuber Fuji Genki (see **Figure \ref{fig:genkifuji}**), who with 14,900 subscribers on his main account has published videos both in English and Japanese on accounts as Yamatotube2, *Chan'neru kura-ra* チャンネルくらら and *hoshu ronkaku chan'neru+* 保守論客チャンネル+ (lit. 'Conservative Polemicist Channel+'). A conservative online voice, he has referred to himself tongue-in-cheek as *nekouyo* ネコウヨ (a wordplay literally meaning 'cat-right' as opposite to 'net-right'). Of note is the English language antagonizing both Chinese imperialists and Japanese leftists as anti-Japanese elements, and the literal translation "Japan You Don't Know" (most likely from the common rhetorical device *anata no shiranai nihon* 「あなたの知らない日本」), implying a *real* Japan hidden by the mainstream press.

##Wikipedia[^76]

Whereas the software the Japanese 2channel and English 4chan are based on were influential in shaping online communities throughout the late 90s and early '00s, the software Wikipedia (a free online encyclopedia based on transparent and open collaboration) runs on, MediaWiki, has since its inception in 2002 gained much traction worldwide. Uses range from the political realm[^94] to lighter topics,[^93] and Wiki-style sub-communities are build around every possible aspect of popular culture.[^95] Wikipedia itself is as of 2019 the \nth{5} most visited website in the world and \nth{6} most in Japan; with 7 percent of all articles being written in Japanese (the \nth{2} most represented language on Wikipedia). The specific mannerisms of utilizing Wikipedia have formed distinct subcultures and group dynamics, and vandalism or so-called *edit-wars* (disputes over content through reverting and adjusting user contributions) are not uncommon elements of those. The open nature of Wikipedia and its underlying MediaWiki software permits us a glimpse into topics that Wikipedia editors place high importance on. **Table \ref{tab:50mostcont}**,[^64] for example, displays the top fifty most 'contentious' articles on the Japanese Wikipedia as of 2019 (in other words, articles that have high rates of such *edit-warring*, based on the amount of reverts done in contrast to the total amount of edits).[^66]

\end{table}

Based on these statistics, I find that regardless whether sorted by total revisions, total reverts or total 'contention', the lists of Wikipedia articles are dominated almost entirely with articles devoted to Japanese idol pop-artists (in particular AKB48) and animation (specifically One Piece). Sorted on either total reverts or total contention these lists include throughout the years topics such as Abe Shinzo, Japan, Sōka Gakkai, the Nanjing Massacre, Netto-Uyoku, both South and North Korea, and Zainichi Koreans. Throughout other years, this list has included topics such as the South Korean figure skater Yuna Kim,[^33] the topic of male discrimination (*dansei sabetsu* 男性差別), an article on a supposed *Korean origin theory* (*kankoku kigen-setsu* 韓国起源説), global warming, Ishihara Shintarō, Hashimoto Tōru and the former Prime Ministers Asō Tarō, Hatoyama Yukio, Kan Naoto and Koizumi Jun'ichirō. 

Of immediate note is 1. the position of Netto-Uyoku as \nth{2} most contentious article (already implying that Netto-Uyoku are highly active on Wikipedia), and 2. a seemingly distinct lack of articles that would otherwise be considered controversial topics, such as the territorial disputes of the Liancourt Rocks. These are however missing primarily due administrators' ability to 'protect' articles from anonymous edits (or even any edit in general) until new information comes up. That being said, on a platform that is dominated by articles on pop-culture when viewed over large time lapses, a closer look at top edits per month does reflect topical events. As that particular dispute gained renewed traction, so did the Japanese article on the Liancourt Rocks, for example, reach first spot as the most edited article of August 2012. Moreover, so did between May and June 2006 various other articles related to Netto-Uyoku sentiment reach first or otherwise high spots.[^81] 

During the early 2000s when articles on common topics were still being written from the ground up, reverts were uncommon to the point that they are not a reliable way to express quantifiable controversy in this time. Based on the total amount of revisions as an indicator of perceived importance by the Japanese Wikipedia community, top articles in the early days of the Japanese Wikipedia contain however few articles related to such pop culture phenomena. Instead in 2003 the most revised articles include the topics of the Japanese railway,[^72] religion[^73] as well as topics related to China[^74] and Japanese history.[^75] In 2004 2channel joins the top of this list as second most revised article, alongside articles related to media-channels[^80] and the Korean peninsula. It is only from 2005 onwards that we perceive an increase of mass-edited articles on pop-media (animation as *crayon shin-chan* クレヨンしんちゃん, *doraemon* ドラえもん, One Piece and Naruto reach the top of this list). Although this rate has decreased over the years, the rate of anonymous edits on the Japanese Wikipedia is still remarkably high when contrasted to the global scale; an indication of 2channel's *modus operandi* seeping into Wikipedia (see **figure \ref{fig:anon-wiki}**). Although anonymity is to be taken with a grain of salt, considering IP addresses are publicly available, of note here is particularly the intent of the user not to be associated with a user-name.

\end{figure}

Using the statistic tool-set *XTools*,[^77] one gets further insights into the revision history of each article, as well as into the Wikipedia users contributing to them. An overview of revision statistics on two contested topics (see **figures \ref{fig:xtools-zainichi} and \ref{fig:xtools-asahi}**) shows a sharp increase of activity in the period of 2009-11, an increase that cannot be explained solely by a rise in usage of Wikipedia as a platform but falls in line with the aforementioned increase of interest in right-wing politics (**figure \ref{fig:politictrends}**) and Netto-Uyoku (**figure \ref{fig:nettouyoku}**). This is confirmed by the relative word count to the amount of edits, which is aside, aside from the 2011 peak in edits of **figures \ref{fig:xtools-zainichi}**, not in proportion and indicates again the contentious character of the topic on Wikipedia.

The article on Netto-Uyoku then has seen 2,281 edits by 756 users since its creation on September 30, 2005 with an anonymous revision: 

>「ネット上で徘徊・跋扈する馬鹿な右翼のこと。２ちゃんねるなど無責任な管理者が運営する掲示板に生息する。また、まじめな議論をおこなおうとする、右翼に批判的な掲示板などを荒らすことも生業としている。２ちゃんねる風のプラカードをもって、杉並で「つくる会」教科書採択のために策動した連中もいる。」

>"*Netto-jō de haikai bakko suru bakana uyoku no koto. 2-Chan neru nado musekinin'na kanrisha ga un'ei suru keijiban ni seisoku suru. Mata, majimena giron o okonaou to suru, uyoku ni hihantekina keijiban nado o arasu koto mo nariwai to shite iru. 2-Chan neru kaze no purakādo o motte, Suginami de `tsukurukai' kyōkasho saitaku no tame ni sakudō shita renchū mo iru.*"

>"Stupid right-wingers loitering on the Internet. They inhabit bulletin board systems (BBS) such as 2channel, operated by irresponsible administrators. Moreover, they call for trolling Bulletin Board Systems meant for attempting serious discussion and/or for making critical arguments against the right. There are also those that have participated in the Suginawa protests on the adoption of a new school textbook with 2channel-themed placards."[^82]

Since then the article has grown to contain 70,744 characters and is linked to from other pages 405 times, an indication of the term steadily seeping into public discourse. As shown in **table \ref{tab:50mostcont}**, the topic remains controversial amongst certain users. The very last edits in my data-source (and thus the most recent at July 2, 2019) are the following addition and its subsequent revert:[^83]

>「日本を取り戻し、世界でもっとも輝ける国にするために日々研鑽を惜しまない素晴らしい方達である。そのために、日本人による正当な民族差別を率先して行っている。」

>"*Nihon o torimodoshi, sekai de mottomo kagayakeru kuni ni suru tame ni hibi kensan o oshimanai subarashīi kata-tachi dearu. Sono tame ni, nihonjin ni yoru seitōna minzoku sabetsu o sossen shite itte iru.*"

>"These are wonderful people who do not spare time in order to restore Japan and making it the brightest country in the world. To that end, they takes the initiative of legitimating ethnic discrimination by Japanese people."

Here, the phrasing of 'restoring Japan' is eerily similar to prime minister Abe's political catch-phrase 'We will restore Japan' (*nippon o torimodosu* 「日本を、取り戻す。」), used during his political campaign against the DPJ in the wake of the 2011 earthquake. As is what I translated as 'brightest country' similar to prime minister Abe's 『美しい国へ』 (*Utsukushii kuni he* ‘Toward a Beautiful Nation’). The initially vague expressions of 'restoring' (from what?) and 'bright' or 'beautiful' country (defined how?) are implicitly answered by this user: normalization of ethnic discrimination is a means to restore Japan (from ethnic minorities) and make it a bright (ethnically homogeneous) country. 

A constant in these contested pages are large contributions by a small group of people. The top contributor to the article of *Nanking Massacre* (27.7% of all edits, between the period of November 1, 2009 and April 16, 2019), for example, is a user by the handle of *yamato-yashiki* (大和屋敷). This is a user with as of July 2, 2019 16,682 edits over 3,229 pages including 139 edits to English Wikipedia articles (where he has since been blocked from contributing, having focused primarily on topics related to Korea, such as 'Korean Nationalism' and the 'Japan-Korea Treaty of 1910', as well as 'softer' topics as *otaku*, *Yakiniku* and 'Secret photography'). Moreover, this user is amongst the top editors (based on frequency of personal edits compared to total edits) for other such contested topics as *Netto-Uyoku* (first place with 19.7%). The second largest contributor to this article (with 166 or 15.7% edits between October 21, 2015 and March 17, 2019) is 'Japanese Sincerity', which is a twin-account of the since blocked account 'Japanese spirits' (and most likely a reference to *yamato-damashii* 大和魂, a normative expression of *nihonjin*-style Japanese ethno-nationalism). A look at the profile page of 'Japanese Sincerity' on Wikipedia reveals the following information:

>「得意分野\newline
日本史（特に昭和の時代）。イデオロギーでなく、事実の正確な記述や広い視点による解釈に固執します。記述に恣意的に反映するかどうかは別として、個人的には日本の皇室の大ファンであり、それも昭和天皇、上皇、今上天皇と戦後皇室の在り方に個人的には共感しています。」

>"*Tokui bun'ya\newline

\end{figure}

Contrary to that statement, the topics of choice and their particular edits do reveal an ideological point of view. Of note are this user's 455 contributions to the English language Wikipedia, as well as several to the Spanish (46) and French Wikipedia (28), dominantly on topics of Japanese war crimes. As shown in **\ref{fig:js-abe} and \ref{fig:js-inada}**, through the now banned twin-account of 'Japanese spirits' this user has formerly contributed to English articles on Inada Tomomi and Abe Shinzō with apologetic, reactionary edits (the former which are as of July 9, 2019 still largely in-tact). Support for the revisionist agenda of Nippon Kaigi is in this user's logic an act of honor and patriotism. Criticism of the Yasukuni Shrine too is disrespectful towards "the souls of dead Japanese soldiers" and, furthermore, the 2017 critical documentary *Yasukuni* betrayed a Chinese tinted political agenda. Through their main account 'Japanese Sincerity', this user has since opted for a softer tone. Their last contribution, on the article for 'Pantingan River massacre' (which too is still largely intact as of July 9, 2019), attempts to downplay events with the following line:

>"Following Tsuji's abnormal order which was considered to be a war criminal and beyond his commission, Japanese 122 Regiment of Sixty-fifth Brigade executed the US and Philippine soldiers in the Pantingan River [2]. Colonel Takeo Imai, of another Japanese regiment, was doubt the authority of the order which came from the top but not clearly from who? and Imai ignored the cruel order and did not any execusion[3] (*sic*)."

Another prolific Wikipedia user (and contributor to the *Nanking Massacre* article with 10.5% of its edits done between December 3, 2009 and April 30, 2019) is the user '*kachō fūgetsu setsugetsuka keibu*' ('花蝶風月雪月花警部').[^70] The actions of this user however involve policing primarily un-sourced or biased edits, and an online search of this account reveals several topics accusing that user of being an 'Anti-Japanese leftist traitor' (*han-nichi baikoku sayoku* 反日売国サヨク) and an ethnic Korean (*zainichi chōsenjin* 在日朝鮮人).[^68] One other such active user, 'JapaneseA' (2,655 pages created and 46,343 pages edited) has received similar critique.[^100] Their policing conflicts have led to bans of active editors such as 'Chichiii', who has added 11,999 edits to 3,926 articles and authored 572 articles including *Emperor Apologize request by Korea* (*Kankoku ni yoru ten'nō shazai yōkyū* 韓国による天皇謝罪要求), *Foreign Regional Suffrage* (*gaikokujin chihō sansei-ken* 外国人地方参政権) and *The issue of the Chinese Embassy and Primary land acquisition in Tokyo* (*chūgoku taishikan tonai ittōchi baishū mondai* 中国大使館都内一等地買収問題).[^98]

If we take a look at some of the other contested articles, similar trends arise. Going through the revision history of articles as *'Japan'* (*'nihon'*, 日本), *'Hatoyama Yukio'* (鳩山由紀夫), *'Foreign suffrage in Japan'* (*nihon ni okeru gaikokujin sanseiken*, 日本における外国人参政権), *'Zainichi Koreans'* (*zainichi kankoku・chōsenjin* 在日韓国・朝鮮人), *'Asahi Shimbun'* (朝日新聞) and *'Zaitokukai'* reveals primarily edits by 'Chichiii', *'kachō fūgetsu setsugetsuka keibu'* ('花蝶風月雪月花警部' and '*yamato yashiki*' ('大和屋敷').[^71] Another top contributor with a telling user name to that latter article is the user *'takeshima wa nihon'* ('竹島は日本', translated as 'Takeshima is Japanese'), who has also contributed to articles related to 2channel,[^78] Baseball star Suzuki Ichirō (popularly referred to as *Ichirō*, イチロー) and the Wikipedia article on Makoto Sakurai. 

One aspect of personalization on Wikipedia is the usage of badges on one's profile.[^89] Take, for example, user 'S.S.Exp.Hashimoto'; a user primarily active on railway-related articles but just as well a top contributor to the articles *'Netto-Uyoku'*, *'Taiwan'* and *'Foreign suffrage in Japan'* (with a total of 4,698 pages edited between February 28, 2004 and July 6, 2019, including several on the English Wikipedia). The user-page includes some information on the user's interest in railways (the handle itself is a reference to the Keio Line semi-express train towards Hashimoto, Kanagawa prefecture) and 2channel. More interesting is however this user's usage of badges, as illustrated on **figure \ref{fig:hashimoto}**. Badges that should be pointed out are not uncommon, as seen on the profile of a top contributor to the article on *'asahi shimbun'*, user *'gokoku bōkyō-dan'* ('護国防共団', lit. 'anti-communist national defense corps') and article *Taiwan* top editor `Kamakura' (who between August 19, 2003 and June 30, 2019 had made 7,616 edits to over 3,933 articles, including 315 edits on the English wikipedia). This is illustrated on respectively **figure \ref{fig:defense-corps}** and **figure \ref{fig:kamakura}**.

In all three cases do the users express support for the Self Defense Force (SDF). 'S.S.Exp.Hashimoto' and 'Kamakura' both take pride in their identity as 2channel users,[^69] both have Shintoist beliefs and both express their support for nuclear energy. 'S.S.Exp.Hashimoto' and *'gokoku bōkyō-dan'* ('護国防共団') then both describe themselves as conservative. *gokoku bōkyō-dan* (護国防共団) and 'Kamakura' show their support for the Emperor System and the LDP. User *gokoku bōkyō-dan* (護国防共団) takes pride in being Japanese, shows support for the ultra-conservative Nippon Kaigi, political visits to the Yasukuni Shrine and the LDP. 'S.S.Exp.Hashimoto' expresses a dislike towards Mainland China and communism, while simultaneously expressing love for Taiwan (as documented earlier, a Wikipedia topic this user is affiliated with) and the United States. Finally, 'Kamakura' has further syncretic tendencies expressing belief in both Taoism and Buddhism, and furthermore expresses support for the death penalty.[^79]

The hyper-linked design of the MediaWiki software, reflecting on @azuma_otaku:_2001 and @manovich_software_2013, offers previously unseen ways of global interconnection by linking articles between the different language variants of Wikipedia. This has political consequences as well. I have already shown the tendency of editing articles on non-Japanese Wikipedia variants (primarily the English variant) by several users depicting tropes common to the Netto-Uyoku. Whereas the English article[^59] portrays Netto-Uyoku as "Japanese neo-nationalists who interact almost entirely within their own cyber community, shut off from the rest of Japanese society" and who "first appeared on the Internet during the Lost Decade, which was an economic crisis in Japan from the 1990s to 2010s" (perpetuating the idea of Netto-Uyoku as a disenfranchised by-product of the Lost Decade), on November 11, 2018 a user by the name of 'Normal Japanese' replaced the page contents with "anti-Japanese left wings will perish" (which was reverted one minute afterwards). The normative framing of oneself as "normal Japanese," representing the general will of the Japanese people, is a common red line throughout Netto-Uyoku rhetoric, as is the usage of "anti-Japanese left wings" (a direct translation of *han'nichi sayoku*, 反日左翼) and 'perish' (*shine*, 死ね) as aggressive verbal attack.[^84] 

With heated tensions between Japanese and South Korean nationalists, it is not unexpected to find traces of struggles online and on Wikipedia either (as suggested by **figures \ref{fig:netto-altright}** and **\ref{fig:netto-altright-kor}**). Although the page on Zaitokukai has variants in different languages, the article on the umbrella term for such organizations as the Action Conservative Movement is available only on the Japanese and Korean Wikipedia. Another example of utilizing interlinking articles for nationalist purposes: a large-scale DDoS (cyber-)attack on 2channel's servers occurring on March 1, 2010 has an article in Japanese (*Kangokujin ni yoru 2-chan neru e no saibātero jiken* '韓国人による2ちゃんねるへのサイバーテロ事件') and Korean (*2010nyeon han·il sam-iljeol saibeo gong-gyeog sageon*, '2010년 한·일 삼일절 사이버 공격 사건'). An English variant ('2010 Japan–South Korea cyber-warfare') was created on December 24, 2014, 4 years after the initial event, by a Korean-speaking user.[^90] Translated to English, the Japanese title of the page is more akin to "the cyber-terror incident on 2channel by South Koreans," explicitly using a reference to terrorism as an ideologically motivated attack. The Korean title then translates to "The 2010 South Korea-Japan 3-1 cyber-attack," with 3-1 (*sam-iljeol*, 삼일절) as an explicit reference to the Korean March \nth{1} Movement in 1919. 

Another common aspect of Wikipedia are lists or categories with personally identified correlations. Take for example the categories 'Anti-Japanese sentiment in Korea' (containing 61 pages), its Japanese equivalent *Kankoku no han'nichi kanjō* 韓国の反日感情 (56 articles) and its Korean equivalent *daehanmingug-ui ban-il gamjeong* '대한민국의 반일 감정' (80 articles). The English page has an additional "See also: Category:Anti-Korean sentiment in Japan." tag that is present neither on the Japanese nor Korean variants.[^91] That latter category, Anti-Korean sentiment in Japan, then contains 33 articles (including a link to 2channel), with edits made to primarily by users who have expressed Korean identity or interest into Korea in their user-pages (such as the user 'Caspian blue'[^85]). Between April and July 2019‎, an anonymous user made additions to several pages such as Japanese idol Chiba Reiko[^96] and film director and comedian Kitano Takeshi, including the Wiki-formatted reference `\texttt{[[Category:Anti-Korean sentiment in Japan]]}'. As of July 2019 Kitano Takeshi is still listed as belonging to this category, although neither the English nor Japanese variant contain mentions of anti-Korean sentiment either on the main document or in prior revisions).[^99]

The revision pages of those pages too confirm what I have thus far demonstrated. Users are trying to influence public perception on sensitive topics both regionally and internationally. Of note here is the user *'ao-oniyoshi'* ('青鬼よし'), with 7,662 edits on 2,192 articles between February 22, 2009 and July 9, 2019 and a top editor on the Japanese article for '*Hatoyama Yukio*' and '*March \nth{1} Movement*'. This user's edits include 577 edits on the English Wikipedia, focusing primarily on the article for 'Kofun period' (87), 'Japan–Korea disputes' (30) and 'Korea under Japanese rule' (15) before this account on the English Wikipedia was locked.[^88] Since then, a 'Category:Suspected Wikipedia sockpuppets of Azukimonaka' lists *'ao-oniyoshi'* ('青鬼よし') as one of 25 double accounts of one suspected user contributing edits to controversial topics on Korean and Japanese history. Amongst the other users in this list are the user 'KoreanShoriSenyou' (which when written in Japanese characters could refer to the account as intended exclusively or possibly combatively for disposal or procession of anything Korean-related, コリアン処理専用 or コリアン処理戦用) and Azukimonaka (whose top edits include pages on 'Eugenics in Japan', 'Foreign relations of South Korea', 'Japanese expansionism' and 'Manga', as well as on the category of 'Anti-Japanese sentiment in Korea').

 \end{subfigure}
 \caption{\label{fig:caspian} Edit Skirmish on English Wikipedia Page 'Anti-Korean sentiment in Japan'.}
\end{figure}

Finally, another user, 'Sennen goroshi' (which is when written in Japanese, 千年殺し, a reference to a particular practical joke in the animation Naruto) has made 4,837 edits on 1,588 English Wikipedia pages between July 28, 2007 and June 16, 2019, dominantly on topics related to Japanese and Korean nationalism. Yet this user does not appear to be Japanese.[^86] Nevertheless does this user, on the English language Wikipedia page for 'Anti-Korean sentiment in Japan', engages in a brief edit-war with the aforementioned user 'Caspian blue', as seen on **figure \ref{fig:caspian}**. Taking sides based arguably through the soft-power influence of both South Korea and Japan,[^87] two seemingly unrelated users thus attempt to tip the balance in favor of a country they feel an imagined affiliation with.

##Online Grassroots counter-Activism: 'Ban Matsuri'

As I have demonstrated in the first chapter, the world wide web and social media platforms are increasingly relevant tools for shifting public opinion. Moreover, this is done from the ideologically populist stance that these media—*bottom-up* media lacking so-called gatekeepers—represent the people's will. In other words, a Habermasian online public sphere on which counter-hegemonic ideologies have space to develop and seep into civil society. In this chapter I demonstrated several attempts to steer public opinion by those who reside in 2channel's most active echo-chambers. This was done on an active level by using widespread tools as Wikipedia, but also passively through reinforcement of what is framed as the people's voice on *matome* aggregation websites. Those aggregation websites should be noted for being profit-driven and acting on a demand of (such-framed) *Japan-bashing*. 

The consumption 'anti-Japan' news serves discursive processes of nationalist self-socialization through antagonistic Othering. In other words, a construction of the self as being both morally superior to the irrationality of the dehumanized Other, but also as the *real* victim of a greater anti-Japanese conspiracy driven by the leftist elites, mainstream news and an imagined foreign enemy. This is further framed in a cynicism adherent to these cyber-communities. Alongside the blogs I have already mentioned, can the latter be deduced from the mere names of certain aggregation blogs and channels: 'Kimchi Newsflash' (*kimuchi sokuhō* 「キムチ速報」), 'Traitor Newsflash' (*baikoku sokuhō*, 「売国速報(\^ω\^)」), 'Funny Anti-Japan Channel' (*omoshiro han'nichi chan'neru* 「おもしろ反日チャンネル」), 'Zainichi Korean Crime Newsflash' (*zainichi hanzai sokuhō*, 「在日犯罪速報＜丶\｀$\forall$\´＞」), and 'Mizuki's *Girl Knowledge Korea Declaration*' (*'Mizuki no joshi chi Kan sengen'*, 「みずきの女子知韓宣言（\´$\forall$\｀\*)」). Of note is the usage of *emoji* signifiers in the latter three cases here; another textual tool for making more accessible and appealing what is in essence highly ideological rhetoric.[^122]

Some of those media platforms have however reacted to those trends by implemented specific terms of services that prohibit inciting violence or hate. Users have the option to report content, and based on the amount of reports will those platforms then automatically *flag*, block or remove accounts and their associated content. The colloquial 'Netto-Uyoku ban' (ネトウヨBAN祭り *neto-uyo ban matsuri*, lit. 'Netto-Uyoku Ban Festival') is one such instance of grassroots activism based around those methods (In the context of *2channel*, *matsuri* 祭り refers to a large-scale online meeting with a particular ideological purpose, such as 'attacking' a self-perceived other). The *Asahi Shimbun* reported in 2018 a large scale deletion of YouTube channels, including that of Toranomon News regular Takeda Tsuneyasu [@shino_eng:_2018]. A trend amongst deleted videos was the usage of automated voices and text scrolling over a black background or several images. Furthermore, a look at the list of removed accounts reveals a slight majority of accounts with unrelated Western usernames (such as the most recent deleted accounts 'Sandy Kerrigan', 'Beauty Eansworth', 'Erica Bray' and 'Vickie Cooper'), with a high ratio of uploaded videos in comparison to the amount of subscribers [@j_wiki_completed_2019], which strongly suggests the usage of double accounts (*sockpuppets*) and bots, as referred to in chapter two by @schafer_japans_2017. 

This was followed by a *Sankei Shimbun* tabloid reporting over 2000 YouTube channels and 2000 Twitter accounts suspended (including that of Zaitokukai's Sakurai Makoto), with over 50 million tweets deleted and cited damage to channels such as *Bōkoku no ījisu* (「某国のイージス」, lit. 'A Certain Country's Isis'),[^108] that of Kazuya and Toranomon News [@ogawa_eng._2019] and Tony Marano (known as *tekisasu oyaji* テキサス親父 or 'Texas Daddy').[^106] In a final diversion, the latter is worth expanding upon as another source of 'foreign' reconfirmation. Various publications have been accredited to Tony Marano, including a book co-authored by Toranomon News associate Kent Gilbert (『素晴らしい国・日本に告ぐ！』 *Subarashī kuni ・ Nihon ni tsugu!*, lit. "Wonderful Country, I'll Inform japan!") and an article co-authored by Hyakuta Naoki (「朝日の慰安婦報道を断罪する！」 *Asahi no ianfu hōdō o danzai suru!*, lit. "We condemn the Asahi Comfort Women Report!").[^8] On his main English account 'PropagandaBuster' Tony Marano writes "In an attempt to counter political correctness from the news media, I will examine propaganda masquerading as truth in the America news media. Also explore and expose the mental disorder of liberalism and political correctness infecting Hollywood, academia, and the re-education camps (public schools). Unchecked far left liberals in the United States are the single cause for the rapid decline of this nation, we must counter their leftist, anti-American ideology on every level." A textbook example of neo-nationalism on the Internet, and if translated in a Japanese context, a textbook example of Netto-Uyoku.[^1]

The users behind the 'Netto-Uyoku ban' are users that identify themselves with particular subcategories of *2channel*, including the aforementioned *kenmō* board (「嫌儲」), the Korean-centered board *hanguru* (「ハングル」) and a board designed for the discussion of baseball *Nandemo jikkyō (jupitā)* 「なんでも実況 (ジュピター)」. Moreover, while discussion on their activities happens on 2channel, they are they using MediaWiki software to organize themselves and inform on grassroots-level methods to counter what they deem to be Netto-Uyoku carriers of hate-speech. Those users have not just reported and documented YouTube and Twitter accounts they deemed belonging to Netto-Uyoku users, but by reporting blogs and other websites using means like Google's Adsense, they effectively block the income of such accounts. Furthermore, on their Wiki-homepage they have explicitly called out for the revision of Netto-Uyoku leaning Wikipedia articles (「ネトウヨのウィキペディアの偏向記事を改善するんだ」 "*neto-uyo no wikipedia no henkō kiji o kaizen surunda*", lit. "We're improving the Wikipedia articles with Netto-Uyoku inclinations") [@hangul.shoutwiki.com_wikipedia_2019].

##Conclusion

Like elsewhere in the world, Wikipedia as a platform and the software structure behind it are increasingly relevant to Japanese Internet users' methods for informing oneself. Nevertheless, as demonstrated on the previous pages political topics are dominantly revised by a small group of Wikipedia users in order to express political ideology and influence the public opinion. I have further shown ties between editors on the Japanese Wikipedia and 2channel, both in methods of organization (high tendencies for editing anonymously as well as using MediaWiki platforms for meta-discussions on Wikipedia) and in taking one's usage of *2channel* as a source of pride and identity. Neither are these users expressing their interests on Wikipedia exclusively around political topics either, with either having a history of editing topics on popular culture, or explicitly referencing those topics on their profile. The dominance of Japanese popular culture and the soft-power strategy of Cool Japan is further proven by the high percentage of articles[^92] and edits devoted to popular culture topics like Japanese animation and idol formations. The time-line of increase in edits on contentious topics then too generally falls in line with my hypothesis of populist neo-nationalism becoming the hegemonic ideology during the crucial years of 2009 - 2011. Moreover, due to the ease of intersection with other language versions of Wikipedia, the most dedicated among those editors attempt the same thing on a global scale. Something that is not done solely as an expression of (Japanese) nationalism, either. The international reach of soft-power strategies for disseminating the hegemonic ideology lead to such phenomena of neither ethnically Korean or Japanese citizens trying to tip the balance of information-making in favor of either nation. 

Channeling McLuhan, @azuma_otaku:_2001 and @manovich_software_2013 I've further drawn attention to the technical structure of the software behind some of these cyber-communities in which self-socialization and dispersion of ideology occurs. That is to say, imagined cyber-communities build around shared ideological values and utilizing normative rhetorical devices for influencing public opinion on the Internet as a public sphere. Capitalizing on the early growth of cyber-nationalism on the most active of 2channel's boards, so called curated *matome* blogs started aggregating content as being representative of the online voice, adding attractive titles to draw in clicks and increase profit through online advertisements. In protest, parts of those sub-communities relocated and started viewing the previous board as their imagined Other, resulting in a polarizing effect amongst its users and enhancing the echo-chamber effect of the communities *matome* blogs aggregate. As illustrated, this has the potential to spread like wildfire, enforcing political biases on a global scale.

As cyber-nationalists normalized their ideology spread throughout civil society, backed by politicians and capitalized on by populist right-wing influencers such as those of Toranomon News, so too then did a counter-ideological grassroots movement attempt to disrupt these trends. One such expression, the 'Ban Matsuri', while still rooted in the contrarian 'new frontier' ideology of the World Wide Web, was formed by users of the same 2channel community, including those that were deterred from being aggregated profit-seeking *matome* blogs.  Using MediaWiki for the organization and administration of their counter-activism, their actions have led to the removal of income for influential news-aggregation websites and the deletion of thousands of public YouTube and Twitter accounts, affecting Toranomon News affiliates as well.

\chapter*{Conclusion}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Conclusion} 

In my introductory first chapter, I bring the phenomenon of the Netto-Uyoku to a global level as a localized expression of what I call cyber-nationalists, and draw parallels with other such online instances in the United States and Belgium. I further made the argument that the Internet has seen increasing politicization; ranging from populist usage of big-data and paid propaganda campaigns operating as *faux* grassroots activism, to microcosmic counter-culture subcultures; primarily built (under the influence of Japan's soft power) around the discussion of Japanese pop-culture and disrupting the public discourse on political issues. In that chapter I next listed several questions I intended to answer during this paper:

- What is the *modus operandi* of the Netto-Uyoku to disseminate ideology?
- What are the structural processes of the media platforms that the Netto-Uyoku utilize?
- How do the Netto-uyoku compare to other online-based neo-nationalist movements? Can we speak of a distinct Japanese character compared to contemporary movements, or should we view the Netto-Uyoku primarily as part of a greater trend of Internet-fueled populist neo-nationalism? Secondly, is there a common reaction to, for example, the Alt-Right and Trump-era politics?
- How does the movement organize and mobilize, both online and in real life?
- Is there possible space for furthering a Netto-Uyoku political "agenda" through influencing its international counterparts?

The term Netto-Uyoku was coined fifteen years ago. In my second chapter I have reviewed a select amount of literature both from the early period covering the Netto-Uyoku as a fringe element of greater topics, to more recent literature covering the Netto-Uyoku and the Internet.

In the third chapter, I attempted to map the ideology behind the right-wing reactionary voices utilizing the Internet, drawing on Frankfurt School scholars' theorization of ideology and media. It is a pitfall to apply theory rooted in western cultural traditions without balancing the different socio-cultural contexts of the subject, and arguments could be made against the continuous western hegemony of academia. Yet, when we follow Anderson's and McLuhan's logic on media and literacy as crucial to nationalism, and see the world as a 'global village' connected by the digital, it wouldn't be a far stretch to consider the universal nature of the concepts presented in this chapter.

While I could never claim information warfare, populist demagoguery or nationalism to be new tactics in politics, this is now done to great success on the Internet; fueled by both the technological peculiarities of the Internet itself and the rhetoric formed on Internet subcultures. In the fourth chapter I covered the development of Japanese Internet subcultures and the close ties of Otaku culture with the adaption of the Internet.

https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanhatesthis/brazil-jair-bolsonaro-facebook-elections

In the third chapter, I found many of the ideological goals of the Netto-Uyoku to fall in line with that of the current administration, who have in turn done well in dog-whistling to the Netto-Uyoku. This could be interpreted as one reason for a lack of political success for the Netto-Uyoku-associated Makoto Sakurai and his Japan First Party.

I conclude that the Netto-Uyoku, like its counterparts across the world, is on one hand a continuation of an ideological war 


Whereas the rise in global right-wing populism shook the world in 2016, which falls in line with the wide-spread counter-hegemonic narrative disseminated in part by cyber-nationalists, I argued that this has appeared much earlier in Japan. More specifically in an outburst of public outrage after events occurring around 2011: scandals in politics, public media and the 2011 Fukushima Nuclear Disaster (as suggested on page \pageref{populism-gt} by **Figure \ref{fig:politictrends}**). *Interest*[^23] in politics has taken an increasingly large relative share of Google searches across the world. In Japan, interest has remained relatively stable with the exception of a massive peak in 2011; A massive peak noted by the way on **Figure \ref{fig:nettouyoku}** (page \pageref{nettouyoku-gt}).

Following various contradictions in post-war Japan's society, The New Left and student protests influenced by Marxist scholars shook civil society. Now, anti-intellectual right-wing populists are (sub-)consciously applying the same Marxist school of thought. Contradictions in society, most notably the effects of alienation in the wake of the Lost Decades, have renewed public distrust. Within this sphere of alienation and crises of identity, digital natives built intrinsic cyber-communities with a distinct anti-establishment discourse—a cyber-discourse with vast ties to the libertarian mindset that shaped the ideology behind the Internet in the first place. 

As we see happening across the world, I argued these communities to be ripe for political exploitation (in the form of a potential political electorate) by those same right-wing populists. Whether its Donald Trump's presidential campaigns, Duterte in the Philippines or the Flemish right-wing populist Vlaams Belang in 2019, right-wing populists have since the second half of the 2010 gained considerable support throughout the world by including digital natives in their campaign strategies. Distinct from national-scale politics in the United States however, I conclude that in Japan the current iteration of the LDP administration has successfully capitalized on this public distress. Although perceived societal contradictions up to the '90s shook the core of the LDP strong enough to bring about a massive reform of the voting system, I next argued that from the '90s onwards societal contradictions between the 'hegemonic ideology' and the perceived reality (seen to its inevitable conclusion following the 2011 Fukushima Nuclear Disaster and the reveal of the North Korean kidnappings) brought about a new iteration of the LDP, or rather one that answered to the counter-hegemonic narrative of the Japanese cyber-nationalists. The actions of the Netto-Uyoku and the Zaitokukai have let to *public* disavowal by Abe Shinzo, yet on social media the prime minister uses *dog-whistling* methods to appeal to those groups by expanding (**op inspelen**) upon those groups' rising concerns and antagonizing enemies on common ground: established forms of media, conservation of the ethnic-Japanese identity, and hostile positions towards both the Korean peninsula and China. Perhaps in this sense Steve Bannon had a point after all?

Finally I have demonstrated a higher awareness of group identity amongst those who reject the Netto-Uyoku. If the Netto-Uyoku exist and are to be named, then those who have become aware of this phenomenon and feel rejection form a group identity too, both in the off-line public sphere as on the Internet. Offline we have of course various counter protests such as SealDs, C.R.A.C. and influenced by its Western counterparts, the Antifa. Online we have seen communities form around exposing and removing Netto-Uyoku means of radicalization (I refer in particular to the 2018 - 2019 neto-uyo Ban Festival). It is premature to claim, but perhaps this too can be seen as a trend of greater political shifts?

###\ref{fig:searchengine}

The web-portal Yahoo! Japan (a joint venture between the American Yahoo! and Son Masayoshi's SoftBank) retains a monopolistic grip on the Japanese Internet market as its most visited website. Nevertheless, as seen on **Figure \ref{fig:searchengine}**, Google is by far the dominant search engine, more so when taking into account that Yahoo! Japan's search engine has since 2010 implemented Google's search engine algorithms (which may account for its increase in market share since). Results based on Google's statistics can therefore be argued to effectively reflect the overall interest of Internet users in Japan.

**Figure \ref{fig:politictrends}** suggests a global increase in public awareness of politics (the frequency of searches in part of the total amount of searches has practically doubled) and dominated by a search interest in left-wing topics (crossed by right-wing topics one only in November 2016, in the wake of the presidential elections). In Japan however, interest in political topics as measured by Google Trends remains however fairly stable throughout the line, with one significant voorbarig

###Wikipedia Reverts

In order to calculate contentious Japanese Wikipedia pages I use a rudimentary way of comparing the total amount of reverts to the total amount of revisions on a page (limited to articles, I exclude *namespaces* for pages such as *Userpages*). I wrote a script in the Java programming language to obtain the top 1000 revised articles (both in total and during a certain time span). My dataset is a 5GB data-dump (*jawiki-20190620-stub-meta-history.xml.gz*) obtained from <https://dumps.wikimedia.org/jawiki/20190620/>. This compressed file contains an XML file with meta-data of every Japanese Wikipedia page (such as title, namespace, and revision information) up to 2019-06-20.[^63] Reverts are then based on keywords (eg. 'rv', '取り消し', '巻き戻し') in the comments of revisions and are therefore not completely exhaustive (this would most likely include reverts of acts of vandalism, but will not include the actual act of vandalism in which one reverts parts of- or even the complete article). While this methodologically requires further attention, preliminary results undeniable show in quantifiable ways particular political topics to be in the top of so-called '*Wiki edit-wars*'. I ran the script for each year between the range of 2003 (the beginning of the data-dump) and 2019. Per year I included levels of controversy based both on the total amount of revisions and reverts up to that year, as well as solely on the revisions and reverts committed in that particular frame of time.

### Methodology)
\label{sec:methodology}

[populism_trends]: images/populism_trends.jpg

[^2]: As illustrated on **figure \ref{fig:nettouyoku}**, this usage has since 2009 overtaken by the more pejorative four-character abbreviation *neto-uyo* (ネトウヨ). Unless I am translating texts with the intent of maintaining this pejorative connotation I will however retain the term Netto-Uyoku. Furthermore, I use the Japanese term to indicate this as the localized expression of a larger phenomenon.
[^6]: A literal translation of *kōdō suru hoshu undō* (行動する保守運動).
[^7]: Respectively "The Group Seeking Recovery of Sovereignty" (*Shuken Kaifuku wo Mezasu Kai* 主権回復を目指す会) and "The Citizens’ Group Refusing to Tolerate Special Rights for Zainichi Koreans" (*Zainichi Tokken wo Yurusanai Shimin no Kai* 在日特権を許さない市民の会).
[^9]: Although @higuchi_japans_2016 describe the ACM as ultra-nationalist in nature, this paper agrees with @gill_nativist_2018 in that "‘ultra’ implies a *quantitative* increase in the degree of extremism, from ‘right’ to ‘far right’ to ‘ultra-right’." It will instead utilize the term neo-nationalism to distinct the ACM from ultra-nationalist Japanese militants collectively known as *uyoku dantai* (右翼団体, "right wing groups"). While often used in the context of Europe and North-America's rise in populism, the term neo-nationalism refers to a type of nationalism marked by right-wing populism, cultural racism, anti-globalisation and nativism, and arguably more closely describes the ACM ideologically [@dougherty_new_2016; @hirsh_why_2016].
[^30]: Translates to 'Shield & Friends', a reference to a period of Flemish romantic nationalism (the Battle of the Golden Spurs) and in particular to the \nth{14} century shibboleth for identifying Frenchmen based on their inability to pronounce this phrase.
[^11]: @soll_long_2016 traces fake news in the west back to the invention of print media five centuries ago, to Gutenberg's invention of the printing press in 1439. In his essay, he recalls for example an account in 1475 of deliberate use of misinformation to persecute a Jewish community in Trent, Italy. 
[^12]: Albeit in October 2017 renamed to 5channel (*5-channeru* 5ちゃんねる, accessible at <https://5ch.net>), this paper will for the sake of continuity with previous literature on the topic, continue to refer to this message board as *2channel*. Online, the distinction '5ch (旧2ch)' is most commonly seen.
[^13]: Khellberg came under scrutiny himself for racial remarks and has been referred to as part of a gateway to the reactionary right [@lewis_alternative_2018; @dickson_why_2019; @roose_mass_2019].
[^4]: This theory, known as "The Great Replacement" (not coincidentally the title of the perpetrator's manifesto), is featured on the Identitarian Movement's homepage and has been adopted by populist right-wing figures such as Dutch politician Geert Wilders and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. It has arguably been endorsed by the President of the United States Donald Trump, who has shared tweets with the hashtag "#whitegenocide" [@weiss_opinion_2018; @manjoo_opinion_2019].
[^14]: This paper expands upon the author's undergraduate thesis [@poppe_digitaal_2017], written under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Dimitri Vanoverbeke. In his undergraduate thesis, the author examined the Netto-Uyoku as potential electorate of populist politicians on both a national and regional scale. 
[^16]: In the second article, @laurent_nordactu_2016 describes the *fachosphère* as part of the Identitarian Movement and "*une nébuleuse de sites, de comptes sur les réseaux sociaux, visant à diffuser de la « réinformation », en clair de la propagande allant dans le sens des militants qui les animent*." A nebula of websites and accounts on social networks, designed to disseminate '*réinformation*', or in other words propaganda embracing the ideas of the activists, amongst the users of those platforms.
[^17]: 4chan has been accredited with popularizing many aspects now common to Internet communities. Of note is the self-assessed demography of its users, consisting of a a mostly millennial, male user-base from the United States and Western Europe, listing interests as "Japanese culture, anime, manga, video games and comics" [@noauthor_advertise_nodate; @ellis_4chan_2018].
[^18]: The controversy has had widespread coverage, including condemnation by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and was extensively covered by Alt-Right key-figure Milo Yiannopoulos on the far-right website Breitbart News Network. The outcome of this campaign has been claimed to have had radicalizing effects amongst its supporters [@wofford_is_2014; @johnston_chat_2014;@morgan_analysis_2016; @martens_rally_2017].
[^20]: It should be noted that a short news-report on YouTube covering this topic, "A Lot Of White Supremacists Seem To Have An Asian Fetish (HBO)" by @vice_news_lot_2017, had as of writing a ratio of 6,1K dislikes to 5,6K likes. The comment section included comments such as "absolute state of (((modern journalism))) ... the truth is people longing culture about sincerity, chivalry, family value, etc. the west is beyond saved from the sinner, hedonist, liar, and degenerate." 'ShadyxFiascoX 32' wrote "Personally Hitler loved Japan and said they had a good culture. What the hell is (((Vice))) talking about.", which was liked 166 times. In both cases the triple parentheses (originated from Alt-Right discourse) imply Jewish ownership of the video's owner, Vice News. One comment, by "Ochiai's Channel" misinterprets this video's content by writing "I am Japanese, and can I consider his talk as a hate speech against us?!" His channel, with a follower count of 610 subscribers and viewed over 87K times as of writing, lists "You can paste my videos anywhere, or you can even download it and edit to use it. ... However, if you're anti-Japan or pro-migration, you're not welcome to do any of those in any means" [@noauthor_ochiais_nodate].
[^21]: It is fitting too then that former Vice President of the United States, Al Gore, referred to the Internet in a 1994 speech for the International Telecommunication Union, as 'information superhighways' that would serve as a 'metaphor of democracy' and lead to a 'global community.' The text is available in full at <http://vlib.iue.it/history/internet/algorespeech.html>.
[^22]: "Determinism is a philosophical system that posits every physical event, including human cognition and action, is causally determined by an unbroken chain of past occurrences and therefore makes it possible for us to know future effects with certainty. Technological determinism claims that technology is an autonomous, "self-controlling, self-determining, self-generating, self-propelling, self-propelling, selfperpetuating and self-expanding force ... out of human control, changing under its own momentum and 'blindly' shaping society" [@chandler_act_1995, p.1].
[^5]: A conservative Nippon Foundation platform *nippon.com* English language publication by author Furuya Tsunehiro (a cultural critic, online personality and until 2014 himself a frequent guest on Channel Sakurai). He claims that "disturbing as the voice of cyber-extremism may be, its influence on Japanese politics and society remains limited, and its heyday is nearing an end" [@furuya_roots_2016]. The platform is part of the Sasakawa Peace Foundation, founded by World Anti-Communist League (WACL) member Sasakawa Ryōichi [@kirkup_obituary:_1995].
[^19]: @davison_language_2012 defines this as "a piece of culture, typically a joke, which gains influence through online transmission."
[^24]: After the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, The term Alt-Lite occasionally came into usage to differentiate its relatively moderate members from more extremist white-nationalist Alt-Right members such as Richard Spencer [@nagle_kill_2017]. When referring to the Alt-Right in this paper, this author uses the term as an overarching umbrella term indicating both.
[^26]: For other mainstream news examples, see *The New York Times*' *How The Trolls Stole Washington* [-@hess_how_2017] and the *Washington Post*'s *We Actually Elected A Meme As President* [@ohlheiser_analysis_2016].
[^27]: A news aggregation and discussion platform. Based on combined page views and unique visitors it is, according to Alexa Internet, as of June 2019 the \nth{16} most visited global website. Within the list of social media platforms it is preceded only by YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, as well as the Chinese web portals Tencent QQ and Sohu [@noauthor_alexa_nodate]. 
[^28]: One *The Huffington Post* article, for example, referred to Roman politician Publius Clodius Pulcher as "the Trump of Ancient Rome, a Populist Demagogue Who Helped Bring Down the Republic" [@freeman_meet_2016].
[^29]: The Southern Poverty Law Center reports that although global "terrorist attacks dropped from about 17,000 in 2014 to about 11,000 in 2017 [...] the United States has seen a recent surge in terror-related violence, with 65 attacks [in 2017], up from six in 2006," with two-third "tied to racist, anti-Muslim, homophobic, anti-Semitic, fascist, anti-government or xenophobic motivations" [@morlin_study_2018].
[^32]: Although affinity for Japan by the Far Right is by no means a new phenomenon. In 2010 for example, a European delegation including previous French Front National leader Jean-Marie Le Pen and Belgian Vlaams Belang associate and European Parliament member Phillip Claeys, visited the politically controversial Yasukuni Shrine reportedly on invitation by the far-right movement (*Uyoku Dantai*) *issuikai* [@k.c._how_2010;@phillips_bnp_2010]. 
[^34]: I contrasted the term 'Netto-Uyoku' as a 'Topic' (which includes related keywords collected through neural networks) with the literal search terms '*netto-uyoku*' 「ネット右」 and '*neto-uyo*' 「ネトウヨ」. Interest indicates relative interest to the full amount of searches at that time, it is not an indicator of quantity. The highest value (100) represents the highest proportion of search results with all other results calculated in proportion. For more information on the methodology behind Google Trends as well as other relevant graphs, I refer to **\ref{appendix:googletrends}**.
[^35]: Although these worldwide trends reflect on Japan, they are preceded with a short but strong spike of interest in both July 2011 and August 2012, suggesting the concept of populism had penetrated Japanese public discourse a fair bit earlier as on a global scale. A period, barely a year after the devastating 2011 Tōhoku earthquake in which political outsiders Shintaro Ishihara and Hashimoto Taro were making headlines, current prime minister Abe Shinzo was staging his political comeback, Tsuneo Watanabe, who was once called Japan's most powerful media baron [@onishi_shadow_2006], publishes a book warning against the dangers of populist nationalism (@watanabe_anti-populism_2012), and literary critic Azuma Hiroki gains renewed success with his publication of *ippan-ishi 2.0* (General Will 2.0, 一般意志2.0).
[^36]: <https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/ideology>
[^37]: "The term ideology, which had originally indicated a new science, became a condescending catch-word that served to demarcate political enemies. Ideology and ideologue began to connote the unwarranted interference of philosophical theory in political practices"[ @mudde_oxford_2013, p:19]. These shifts are still on-going in today's political discourse and the term is often used in a dichotomous relationship to the truth or to a "moderate position" such as pragmatism. One recent piece by the USA political think tank Niskanen Center, for example, uses the terms ideologues and extremists interchangeably [@niskanen_center_if_2019], while a 2016 Business Insider article paraphrases Barack Obama as calling Donald Trump pragmatic rather than ideological, "someone who is stringently tied to a political philosophy" [@darcy_obama_2016] and Donald Trump, at the 73rd Session of the United Nations General Assembly, announced his rejection of the "ideology Of globalism" [@schwartz_trump_2018]. 
[^40]: In post-colonial theory, the concept of the subaltern refers to those in the margins of colonial society, lacking of agency and being forced to resort to speak the colonial oppressor's language. Crucial early works on the topic include Edward Said's *Orientalism* (1978) and Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak's deconstruction *Can the Subaltern Speak?* (1983), which criticizes the practice of interpreting the Other through western methodology. Something I feel I am guilty of, writing this very paper on Japanese *digital nationalism* using mostly western traditions of academic theory and methodology as universally applicable. I find some irony too in basing my Japanese resume on my English manuscript, neither of which are my native languages.
[^41]: These concepts have been translated as *War of Position* and *War of Maneuver* [ @buttigieg_gramsci_1995;@gramsci_selections_1985: p.46]. It must be noted that this part of Gramsci's reasoning has since gained renewed popularity and seen appropriation by both Identitarian movements and the Alt-Right. Social institutions education and the mass media are seen as platforms for manufacturing consent to a hegemonic left-wing or globalist ideology, and the notion of Gramsci's counter-hegemony is re-framed as *metapolitics* [@stein_jeff_2018]. Belgian populist right-wing party member Dries Van Langenhove claims his Identitarian youth movement Schild & Vrienden to function as a vehicle of metapolitics [@nws_van_2018], and previous Vlaams Belang leader Filip de Winter added that "The methodology Gramsci promoted is the right one" ("De methodiek die Gramsci aanprees, is de juiste") [@ceulaer_6_2016].
[^42]: In this paper's introduction, I noted the Alt-Right's infatuation with Japan in particular. Asking why, one might look at war-time relations between the far-right in the West and Japan. In Fukushima's mount Iimori, for example, I examined both an archaeological column of Pompeii, donated by Italian fascist leader Mussolini, and a 1930s German donation in the form of a black granite plate with an Iron Cross–as form of praise for the *bushido*-related war-time propagandistic media-event of the White Tiger Company military unit (*Byakkotai*, 白虎隊), the story of 19 teenagers committing ritual suicide after mistakenly believing their castle had fallen during the Bosshin War. Perhaps in more recent memory, one other answer could be found in a dialectic processes of cultural hegemony between Japan and the West. With the widespread '80s narratives of Japan as economic powerhouse and the growing cultural *soft* power of Cool Japan, many a page were written on the *Japanese model* (see for example Chalmers' 1982 *MITI and the Japanese Miracle*), and thus a window opened to sell Japan's hegemonic ideology of *nihonjin* 日本人論 style of (ethno-)nationalism to the West. 
[^43]: Brother of Benedict Anderson, who gained fame with his notion of socially constructed "imagined communities" [-@anderson_imagined_2006].
[^44]: Far below Belgium (9), the United Kingdom (33) South Korea (41) and the United States (48). This ranking is based on among others restrictions of journalism in official press rooms (see concept of the 'reporters club,' the 記者クラブ *kisha kurabu*), strict policies against whistleblowers, and an increasingly hostile public climate towards public media [@noauthor_japan_2019].
[^46]: The company has been involved with other international political campaigns, and was backed by the conservative computer scientist Robert Mercer, an important financial contributor to Breitbart News [@kang_facebook_2018;@rosenberg_how_2019].

[^3]: Summed up in the first chapter of Marx' *Das Kapital* as "Sie wissen das nicht, aber sie tun es," or in English, "They do not know it, but they do it."
[^48]: Although not from a Marxist school of thought, these topics have also been explored by Walter Lippman in his seminal work *Public Opinion* (1922) and Edward Samuel Herman and Noam Chompsky's work on propaganda (an ideological form of communication to gain consent) in mass media, *Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media*.
[^49]: Of semi-related note, this author is coincidentally the father of American politician Pete Buttigieg, a 2020 Democratic Party presidential candidate running on the platform as as the first openly LGBT+ presidential candidate.
[^50]: The very fact that I am applying Marxist critical theory betrays my ideological bias, after all, and I therefore cannot claim objective neutrality.
[^51]: "In reality, it is a material political and ideological formation that has the function of managing the new mode of production of a transnational High-Tech Capitalism" [@rehmann_bernie_2016].
[^52]: These are concepts by the way that Althusser has also systematized as the *ideological state apparatus* and *repressive state apparatus*.

[^54]: In *The Japanese Economy*, @flath_japanese_2005 refers to the zaibatsu as "at best a kind of *petite bourgeoisie* [-@flath_japanese_2005, p.75]. @miwa_fable_2010 in polemic fashion dismisses the *Keiretsu* and *Zaibatsu* (industrial and financial business conglomerates) in its entirety as fictional scapegoats of "Marxist scholars in post-war Japan" and "populist journalists" [@miwa_fable_2010, p.52]. He further argues a historical growing demand for literature on Japanese economics and a lack of Japanese-literate Western economics who have resorted to accounts by academics from other disciplines, perpetuating conventional Japan-centric claims on *main bank systems* and *industrial policy* [@miwa_fable_2010, pp.54-57].
[^55]: Widespread social media platforms as YouTube, Facebook and Twitter are already making efforts to remove contents that is deemed hateful or contains "bigoted ideologies." Donald Trump has criticized this move as being biased against conservative users [@stack_trump_2019;@roose_youtube_2019].
[^57]: Particularly on 4chan and 2channel are ambiguity and cynicism inherent elements of discourse, increasing the difficulty of a critical reading. A blatantly offense message could be masked as irony either as defense for actual offensive intent, or as a deadpan form of inter-textual parody. This phenomenon is referred to as *Poe's Law*.
[^58]: With social media, I refer to all online platforms used for computer-mediated communication in which a sense of community or interactivity can grow.
[^23]: Another interesting expression considering this very word is rooted in capitalist commodity fetishism.
[^60]: Tessa Morris-Suzuki is professor of Japanese History and frequent contributor to *The Asia-Pacific Journal: Japan Focus*. Her academic work focuses primarily on the topic of identity and politics in Japan.
[^61]: She ends with a cautious warning that, reminiscent of Karl Popper's *paradox of tolerance*, "democracy is left impoverished when freedom of hate speech is protected more zealously than freedom of reasoned political debate" @morris-suzuki_freedom_2013.
[^62]: In the wake of the arrest of several Zaitokukai-members, @nikkei_news__2013 published an article revealing his birth name to be Takada Makoto (高田誠). Due to the wide spread usage of his pen name, I will continue to refer to him as Sakurai Makoto.

[^66]: As of 2019, the article with the highest rate of reverts in contrast to its rate of revisions is the topic of Japanese war crimes in Nanjing during the Second Sino-Japanese War. This paper follows the English designations as used by Wikipedia. *Nankin jiken* 南京事件 is therefore not translated as Nanjing Incident but as Nanjing Massacre instead.
[^45]: For the employed methodology I refer to section \ref{sec:wikirevision} (page \pageref{sec:wikirevision}).

[^69]: The catchphrase used on that particular badge (「この利用者は2ちゃんねらーですが何か?」 *Kono riyōsha wa 2-chan nera ̄ desugananika?*) translates as a rhetorical question expressing indifference, "This user is a 2channel-user, so what?."
[^70]: The origin of the name is unclear but possibly refers to a poem. 花蝶風月 *kachō fūgetsu* is the title of a popular *vocaloid* composition *dōjin* album released on Comiket in 2017, and translates as "Beauty of Flowers and Butterflies" or "Blossoms and butterflies, the cool breeze and a bright moon." 雪月花 *setsu gekka* refers to an ancient Chinese poem (attributed to Bai Juyi) and is a common theme amongst ukiyo-e artists. It translates as "Snow, Moon and Flowers." 警部 *keibu* translates as "police force" and possible refers to the user's role as an administrator or supervisor on Wikipedia.
[^71]: Going through the article on *Zaitokukai* in particular reveals a large portion of blocked accounts, including for example contributor *Asahara Shoko* 麻原彰晃, a reference to Aum Shinrikyo founder Asahara Shoko.
[^72]: Such as *'List of railway stations in Japan'* (*nihon no tetsudō-eki ichiran*, 日本の鉄道駅一覧), *'List of railway lines in Japan'* (*nihon no tetsudō rosen ichiran*, 日本の鉄道路線一覧), *'Tokyo Express Railway'* (*tōkyōkyūkōdentetsu*, 東京急行電鉄) and *'Japanese National Railway 113-series Trains'* (*kokutetsu 113-kei densha*, 国鉄113系電車).

[^79]: The user also expresses their love for cats (*kono riyōsha wa neko ga suki desu* 「この利用者は猫が好きです。」). This badge is possibly an inside-reference to the deceased 'Nekosuki600', a *2channel* user who was amongst the earliest contributors to Wikipedia and claimed by user 'Kamakura' to be their role-model. <https://jawp2ch.miraheze.org/wiki/Nekosuki600>.

[^82]: This refers to an event in 2005, *Suginami-ku rekishi kyōkasho saitaku sōdō* (杉並区歴史教科書採択騒動, "Suginami Ward history textbook adoption riot") wherein groups both agreeing with and protesting the adoption of a new history schoolbook for public education (which would lessen the focus on topics deemed masochistic) took to the Suginawa Ward in Tokyo for public protest. *2channel* users in particular protested supposed ties of protesters with the New Left (in particular the Revolutionary Communist League, National Committee or Chūkaku-ha).
[^83]: A user whose further edits include the addition 「日本人に経済保証と謝罪をした上で滅びるべき国家である。」 (*Nihonjin ni keizai hoshō to shazai o shita ue de horobirubeki kokkadearu*, lit. "A nation that after giving economic guarantees and apologies to the Japanese people, ought to be destroyed"), to the Japanese article of '*South Korea*' and some vandalism to the article of South Korean idol formation TWICE. Edits to that article include amongst others changing Japanese member 名井 南 (Myōi Mina) to *han-nichi, baikoku-yatsu* (「反日、売国奴」, 'anti-Japanese, traitorous bastard') and later *uragirimono no nihonjin* (「 裏切り者の日本人」, 'traitorous Japanese').

[^87]: This is of course not limited to controversial elements within Japan-Korea relations. On the English article for 'Senkaku Islands', the American user 'Washuotaku' (according to his Wikipedia profile a reference to the animation series 'Tenchi Muyo!') has between September 2018 and January 2019 regularly reverted edits in favor of Japan's asserted historical control.

[^92]: In a *New York Times* interview, Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales claimed that 80 percent of Japanese Wikipedia articles were devoted to pop culture [@cohen_wikipedia_2009].
[^94]: Governmental instances in the United States use the software as a content management system for internal information sharing (Diplopedia and Intellipedia), for example. WikiLeaks, famous for publishing various sensitive documents, was originally built on this software as well.
[^93]: Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales founded *Fandom*, a for-profit variant of MediaWiki, specifically for in-depth pages on popular culture topics. 
[^95]: I have for example found numerous Japanese Wiki-style outlets solely on the topic of AKB48's idol formations, with <https://48pedia.org> (as of 12-07-2019) alone already containing 2,062 pages.
[^96]: Since 2016 frequent Toranomon News guest Chiba Reiko did publish various works on the topic, such as the 2016 "*Sayonara payoku ― chibarei ga mita sayoku no jittai*" 『さよならパヨク—チバレイが見た左翼の実態—』 (lit.

The entry on 'Chichiii' in particular states "Joined with an account in 2008. A typical neto-uyo, this user happily writes revisions whenever Zainichi Koreans have cause some kind of incident" (*"2008-Nen kara akaunto de sanka. Tenkei-tekina neto-uyodeari, zainichichōsenjin ga nanika jiken o okosu to ōyorokobi de kahitsu suru"*, 「2008年からアカウントで参加。典型的なネトウヨであり、在日朝鮮人が何か事件を起こすと大喜びで加筆する」). For more information, see <https://jawp2ch.miraheze.org/wiki/Chichiii>.
[^99]: Rumors of Takeshi Kitano having either anti-Korean sentiment or being ethnically Korean himself have been renewed in 2018, after a South Korean idol reportedly came under fire for posting on social media a gift he received from the film-maker. The Korea Times erroneously reported 'anti-Korean Japanese filmmaker Kitano Takeshi' as having co-authored a book on the Senkaku Islands with Ishihara Shintaro in the early 2000s [@dong_ikon_2018]. This was echoed by British outlet Metro [@hicap_ikons_2018].

[^101]: @katayama_2-channel_2007 reported in 2017 2.7 million messages per day spread over 800 different categories. Whereas *2channel* was in 2017, a decade after that report, still the \nth{18} most visited website in Japan [@poppe_digitaal_2017, p.15], in its current renamed state as 5channel it has since dropped to \nth{43} position.
[^102]: Which incidentally lies at the root of particular now 'mainstream' *net-slang*, such as the common usage of multiple letters 'w' as signifier of humor (the loose equivalent of the now rather outdated '*lol*', laughing out loud). As abbreviation of '(笑)' (*wara*, 'to laugh'), this *slang* saw its first usage on platforms that required Japanese to be written with the Latin script. 
[^103]: This is pejoratively known as *afikasu* アフィカス, a contraction of *afiriēto* アフィリエイト and *kasu* カス, loosely translated as 'affiliate-tainted'. 
[^104]: A judicial decision ordered a compensation of 2 million yen in favor of the journalist, which was confirmed in a final decision on 11-12-2018 in her favor after an appeal by *hoshu sokuhō* to the highest court was won [@okamoto_eng:_2018].
[^105]: Council member and blogger Kotsubo Shinya (whose blog is located at the subtly-titled *samurai20.jp*) defended *hoshu sokuhō* with the argument that freedom of speech should be absolute and suggested selling goods such as bookmarks as income replacement [@furuta_eng:_2018].
[^1]: On 2019-07-16, a YouTube Japan search (on an unrelated IP address and device, not logged in YouTube, to ensure my results were unaffected by my personal Google search queries.) for 「韓国」 (South Korea) and 「日本」 (Japan) did respectively return his latest video 「字幕【テキサス親父】 韓国に「恩を仇で返される」日本」 (*jimaku [Tekisasu oyaji] Kankoku ni 'on o kyū de kaesa reru' Nihon*, lit. "Subtitled 【Texas daddy】 This is how South Korea repays Japan?") as the \nth{3} and \nth{4} result.

[^110]: A subdivision of the *Breaking News* boards. 嫌儲 *kenmō* is a word play on 嫌韓 *kenkan* (lit. 'Hate Korea') and translates to 'Hate Profit'. The URL itself <https://5ch.net/poverty/> itself contains an English language pun.
[^111]: In a February 21, 2016 thread that is now comically referred to as *poverlution* (a contraction of the board's URL-name 'poverty' and 'revolution') and プリキュア革命 (*purikyua kakumei*, a reference to an animation 'Pretty Cure'), a user asks "I'm thinking about bringing about a labor revolution in this rotten country Japan.

In a similar trend to the 'Anonymous' movement associated with 4chan, a general distrust in mass media was noticeable and users discussed things as cyber-terrorism, strikes and the control of information. While this was the subject of much ridicule, The thread reached its limit of 1000 posts in less than two hours [@5ch.net_eng._2016].
[^112]: Referred to as *biji-uyo* (ビジウヨ, an abbreviation of business-right, *bijinesu-uyoku* ビジネス右翼) and *sutema sōdō* (ステマ騒動, stealth-market unrest).
[^113]: Several reactions claim mind-control (i.e. Marx' notion of 'false consciousness') by the left-wing and ethnic outsiders. See for example: ."..In spite of being controlled by the baby boomer leftists, and Zainichi Koreans and Chinese" (*zainichi chūgokujin, zainichi kankokujin, dankai sayoku ni kontorōru saretekita baka no kuse ni yo* 「在日中国人、在日韓国人、団塊サヨクにコントロールされてきたバカのくせによ」).
[^114]: An earlier trend on 2channel and similar message-boards was the usage of text-based artwork (AA, ASCII Artwork), the Japanese variant of the viral imagery referred to as *memes*. While somewhat out of fashion, they are now recycled in an ironic manner.

See <https://www.weibo.com/6004281123/HCP32zb6L>.
[^119]: Slurs such as *chon* 'チョン' were not uncommon (54 instances).

holds a *matome*-blog wherein she selectively translates Korean reactions to Naver news-articles. 'Mizuki's twitter account states "I love Japan. I hate anti-Japanese sentiment. I want to calmly keep an eye on the past and the future of this country while treating 'facts' as important." (*Nihon ga daisukidesu. Han'nichi ga daikirai. 'Jijitsu' o daiji ni shite reisei ni kono kuni no kako to mirai o mitsumetai.*, 「日本が大好きです。反日が大嫌い。「事実」を大事にして冷静にこの国の過去と未来を見つめたい。」).

# Chapter Four: Reading The Japanese Internet

Some numbers here: how much of world-wide traffic is in English? How much estimated websites are in English?

To what level is freedom of speech protected (on the internet) in Japan?

    This also reminds me of when Derrida came to Japan in 1984 and did a talk with the leading ’80s postmodernists Asada Akira and Karatani Kojin. Karatani said something to the extent that deconstruction was “impossible” in Japan since Buddhist-influenced Japanese thought is already basically “deconstructed.”

    Derrida politely disagreed:

    “I wonder if deconstruction is truly so easy in Japan. I have my doubts about whether we can say that deconstruction is a direct element in Japanese-type thought. Certainly, Japanese often say that Buddhist thought or the Zen of Dogen was already a kind of deconstruction, but I wonder if that is so. If that were really so, then why, for example, has Asada’s book [Structure and Power] received such tremendous attention? If that phenomenon of Asada were nothing more than a repetition of deconstructive elements already found within Japanese thought, then it shouldn’t have called down such an enormous response in contemporary Japan.”

    The level of cultural power held by a digital army of radicalized, disaffected young men hasn’t gone ignored by Prime Minister Abe’s increasingly conservative administration. The Daily Beast revealed last year that Abe is a registered member of an organization called the Nippon Kaigi, or “Japan Conference.” It’s a 38,000-member religious group that believes in extremely conservative ideas — things like the racial superiority of Japanese people, the repeal of equal rights for women, a return to an absolute monarchy, and severe restrictions of freedom of speech.

    By some accounts, the Nippon Kaigi have been pretty successful, especially when it comes to free speech. Between 2015 and 2016, Japan slipped from 61st to 72nd in a global ranking of press freedom conducted by Reporters Without Borders. In February of 2016, Japan’s top TV journalists described the Abe administration’s treatment of free speech as “tantamount to a war between the political power and the media.”

    The Abe government curtails free speech, especially in the media, through strict copyright laws, libel laws, political impartiality regulations for broadcasters, and the Specially Designated Secrets Act, which allows the government to jail journalists for up to five years for working with whistleblowers.

    But Abe's administration has a new trick. Japan’s public broadcaster, NHK, revealed in 2016 that the administration is using taxpayer money to pay a firm to pose as internet trolls. The firm monitors places like 2channel, Twitter, and Facebook, and uses dummy accounts to fight with people who are critical of Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party. The firm regularly reports posts as slander, forcing tech companies to delete them. Everything being monitored is then put in a report that’s distributed to Abe’s cabinet daily.



## Narratives on the Internet and the World Wide Web

it was in 1989, a year forever etched in our cultural collective memories among other due the opening of the Berlin Wall, the Tiananmen Square protests in China and the beginning of the Heisei period in Japan, that we too saw the development of the World Wide Web, and the first Internet connections in Japan.

Internet as expression of post-modernism?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rhetoric

What the Dormouse Said: How the Sixties Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer Industry, 

    It’s easy to mistake the beta rebellion for a youthful, but otherwise undifferentiated, variation on the bad old tradition of patriarchy. Yet the phenomenon bears the unmistakable signs of a new, net-bred brand of misogyny. It exists squarely within the libertarian ethos that infused computer cultures spanning from the early, back-to-the-land, frontier hacker culture of the sixties and seventies to the Californian rebel capitalism of the dotcom neoliberalism of the nineties.

    As the same frontier sensibility that characterized early Internet culture also runs through American gun culture, it’s no great surprise that the rites of gun worship and principled geek isolation should overlap—or that they should find expression in the targeting of women whom beta men believe are dedicated to a matriarchal thwarting of male freedom and desire. But this seamless convergence of women-demonizing forces is, indeed, something new under the sun, an innovative incarnation of the free-floating male grievance that, as we’ve seen, metastasizes through culture. It’s striking, then, to note just how thoroughly both the press and the social media–centric feminist commentariat have consigned the beta rebellion to the dustbin of outmoded patriarchy—treating it as an obsolescing bug, as opposed to a distressing feature, of today’s Internet discourse.

    In her 2013 book Cybersexism, feminist journalist Laurie Penny admits that the culture of digital woman-hating does indeed have a surface affinity with geek culture, but then goes on to suggest that online misogyny is a conservative remnant of the pre-Internet past. “We have a brave new world which looks far too much like the cruel old world” and “recreates offline prejudices,” she writes.

    Academics have echoed this view, characterizing online misogyny as the politics of conservatism and patriarchy reproducing itself anachronistically in new media, or as just another emanation of hegemonic masculinity. For example, in a study of gender and age bias in online communities, Jonathan Warren, Sharon Stoerger, and Ken Kelley wrote that “many age-old forms of discrimination appear to have been preserved.” Pamela Turton-Turner analyzed “recent online hate campaigns mobilized against females,” which, she argues, are “symptomatic of a broader normalization of old-style sexism.” Adrienne Shaw agreed in an article titled “The Internet Is Full of Jerks Because the World Is Full of Jerks,” stating that “misogyny, racism, homophobia, etc. were not invented by the internet.”

## Development of the Internet in Japan

    the philosopher Slavoj Zizek noted after Sanders lost the primaries, left and right are in some sense outdated ideas. The new division in politics is those who favor the current global hegemony and those who are against it. Like the Hollywood heroes, right and left have been competing to become this new radical anti-status quo party. And so far, in both Europe and America, the right has won, implying that, as Arendt predicted, the powerlessness created by bourgeoisie systems of capitalist exploitation might once again implode into far right totalitarianism.

    The ニュース速報（嫌儲）community left for Reddit when 2ch changed their API to force all users to browse the site using an adware-ridden custom browser, which also collected personal information of users. However, I think many of them got bored with Reddit and went back to their own Kenmou-affiliated sites (besides the main board on 2ch, I think there are also Livedoor and mixi communities).

    But the split between the Kenmou community and the rest of 2ch goes back much further. About 10 years ago, matome (affiliate) bloggers began collating threads from News4VIP or ニュース速報（VIP）(similar to /b/, it was originally a place for spam and overall terrible threads but metamorphosed into a generalized chit-chat board about random topics). Average Japanese internet users could find out about net gossip without having to steep themselves in 2ch's unique culture (in 4chan terms: "lurk before you post").

    Because of the kind of users that News4VIPs attracted by virtue of its origins, the anonymity and captive audience inherent in large bulletin boards (GIFT, Japan-style) that allowed users to be 100% honne and abandon tatemae, as well as the culturally-ingrained racism against Chinese and Korean people in Japan, these matome blogs featured a lot of anti-Korean, anti-Zainichi vitriol spewed by VIPpers.

    As these blogs became popular, they became a vehicle for netuyo to advance far right wing causes on the Japanese internet. Furthermore, as their popularity increased, view-count ad money started becoming important, and to get more eyeballs on their posts, matome bloggers engaged in yellow journalism: they sensationalized 2ch posts, posted fake news, and practiced stealth marketing. So now there was a situation where matome bloggers were spreading netuyo crap for profit.

    This incensed the countable-on-one-hand number of left wingers on 2ch to such an extent that the staff gave them their own breaking news board, ニュース速報（嫌儲）, separate from VIPpers. This is where the term kenmou (嫌儲) comes from; it refers opposed to people opposed to the matome. 嫌 means "unpleasant" or "offensive" and 儲 is an uncommon Sino-Japanese character* that means "a store [or reserve] of saved money". In this case, it refers to the ad money accrued by matome bloggers using unscrupulous strategies such as yellow journalism. Why the character 儲 was used, and from where the reading of もう came, I have no idea.

    I've heard whispers that the kenmou community also disliked how the right wing ステマ from the matome blogs was spreading to the anime industry. Though I'm not 100% sure.

    As an aside, 2ch is related to Dwango, which runs a popular video sharing site, and is very, very friendly with the center-right LDP; a nephew of former PM Taro Aso is on its board of directors (and that of Kadokawa, a prolific licensor of novels and manga). Ever wonder why the '政治' category on the latter website is the Japanese equivalent of Breitbart? Now you know.

It is not a coincidence that the commonly used Japanese term for what "fake news", *dema* (デマ), sounds eerily similar; it is after all an abbreviation of the Japanese translation for demagogy (デマゴギー).

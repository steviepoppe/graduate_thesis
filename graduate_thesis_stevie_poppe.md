古いですよー

欧州における右翼ポピュリズムの高揚が、ポピュリズムに関し、より具体的にはポピュリズムとソーシャルメディア（SNS）のつながりに関する研究を前進させた。日本でも、インターネットとコンピュータ・メディア・コミュニケーション（CMC）はポピュリスト運動と右傾化に関連付けられている。更に、安田（2012）、山口（2013）およびMorris-Suzuki（2015）はインターネットが「在日特権を許さない市民の会」（在特会）のような極端な民族主義的市民団体による活動の組織のために使用されているだけでなく、そのグループの基礎自体もCMCによるものだと言及し、そのグループの基礎がインターネット上で右翼的な発言をする人物、いわゆるネット右翼に関連しているとする。そこで、本稿はCMCと日本におけるポピュリズムの関係を明らかにする。

そのため、本稿はまず（ディジタル）ポピュリズムの概念的枠組みを示す。それは、ポピュリズム、SNS、そして日本との関係に関する最近の研究を検討することにより行う。次に、本稿は影響力がある政治活動家の桜井誠と彼によって動員された有権者のネット右翼に焦点を当てた事例研究を行う。ここでは、社会的アイデンティティ ・ アプローチを通じて、ネット右翼の行動を明らかにする最初の試みを提供し、さらに既存のディジタルポピュリズムの概念を再定義することを目指す。最後に、桜井誠のイデオロギーを定量的にポピュリズムに関連付けるために本稿は桜井誠のツイッター活用の部分にテキストの定量分析を行う。

本稿の結論では、まず、SNSや「2ちゃんねる」のような匿名掲示板は、日本で広く普及され、政治的目的のため、更にポピュリスト的な排外主義のイデオロギーを普遍化するための優れた環境を提供するものであるとした。そして、ネット右翼によるポピュリスト的なイデオロギーは主に在日コリアン、近隣諸国、左翼系、マスメディアに見られるような反日運動に対しての拮抗作用と関連しており、その理論に従えば、これらの実体はポピュリスト的なイデオロギーの敵として理想主義的・単一民族主義的・愛国的な日本人によって批判される。最後に、文献は桜井誠をネット右翼に関する著名人と見なしており、更に、定量分析により、桜井誠のイデオロギーが欧州におけるポピュリズムのような排外主義や反動主義のイデオロギーと多くの関連があることを実証した。

\epigraphhead[50]{\epigraph{I sometimes suspect that we're seeing something in the Internet as significant as the birth of cities. It's something that profound and with that sort of infinite possibilities. It's really something new; it's a new kind of civilization.}{\fauxsc{William Gibson}\small\textup{, 1995}\\}}


On 2010-08-28 *The New York times* published an article titled "New Dissent in Japan Is Loudly Anti-Foreign", referring to a rise in politically motivated protest marches associated with a supposed Japanese 'Net-Right'. In his article, Martin Fackler describes this 'Net-Right' (hereinafter referred to by its Japanese term *Netto-Uyoku* ネット右翼)[^2] as "a new type of ultranationalist group ... a virtual community". He goes on to state that "while these groups remain a small if noisy fringe element here, they have won growing attention as an alarming side effect of Japan’s long economic and political decline" [@fackler_new_2010-1].[^1] A small fringe element that is nevertheless noisy enough to reach print press in the United States. In its most commonly applied form the term Netto-Uyoku applies to a loosely connected, decentralized group of Internet users disseminating a form of extreme right-wing discourse online and who are active primarily on social media platforms such as *Twitter*, the anonymous messaging board *2channel* (*2-channeru* 2ちゃんねる),[^12] and streaming services such as *Youtube* and *Niconico* (ニコニコ).[^58]

Far from benign expressions of free speech limited to shadowy corners of the Internet, consequences of such outings have however very much crossed digital boundaries and materialized in disquieting, at times even violent ways. As Fackler alluded to in his *New York Times* piece, the Netto-Uyoku are often name-called in the same breath as the neo-nationalist[^9] *Action Conservative Movement* (ACM), which includes such groups as *Zaitokukai*[^8] and *Shukenkai*[^7] [@higuchi_japans_2016;@gill_nativist_2018]. Furthermore, according to a 2016 investigation by the Japanese department of Justice, a total of 1152 protest marches, xenophobic in nature and associated with the ACM, were found to be held across Japan between the period April 2012 and September 2015 [@nikaido_eng:_2016]. Makoto Sakurai, founder of the Zaitokukai and one key figure in both the ACM and Netto-Uyoku movement, has been arrested for violence associated with such protest marches, stepping down as its leader in 2014. He did however remain a prolific political commentator online, going on to form the populist right-wing Japan First Party in 2016, holding their first convention in a hotel of the equally controversial Toshio Motoya owned APA Group.

Nevertheless, nearly a decade after Fackler's publication in *The New York Times*, coverage of the Netto-Uyoku and related topics such as the ACM and Zaitokukai remains relatively scarce.[^4] Moreover, whenever the topic does reach mainstream outlets, there appears to be a tendency of framing the Netto-Uyoku as little more than a fringe movement and side-effect of economical malaise with little real-life influence [ @furuya_roots_2016][^5].[^59] This is in spite of the fact that, as shown above, actions associated with this movement have had real-life consequences, not the least including the 2016 adoption of an anti-discrimination law in order to curb hate speech. Additionally, a 2017 paper on political bots in Japan even went as far as to suggest a hidden nationalist agenda of Prime Minister Abe Shinzo tied to that of the Netto-Uyoku, and viewing them as a potential "enormous online support army of Abe’s agenda" [@schafer_japans_2017], something that the author of this paper too has previously alluded to.[^14]

It goes without saying that expressions of neo-nationalist sentiment taking place largely within the confines of social media and shaped by a distinct Internet discourse are by no means limited to Japanese territory. The outcome of the United States' 2016 presidential elections, the 2016 British Brexit-referendum and the rise of neo-nationalist (that is to say, right-wing populist) ideology amongst various European political campaigns can be seen as trends of greater global political struggles. When more closely examined it will then too come to no big surprise, considering the extent it has penetrated our daily lives, that the role of the Internet and social media was of no small importance in those outcomes. Facebook came under strong public scrutiny, in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal[^46], for example, and backing the cult of amongst others personality of respective presidents Vladimir Putin, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Xi Jinping, as well as the in 2016 elected president of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte, are supposed "online troll armies". Deliberately and both on a voluntary or paid basis spreading disinformation on social media and attacking self-perceived enemies of their respective presidents, these online troll armies have on multiple instances been accredited with manipulation of political discourse online in order to influence elections, including in more recent memory the 2016 presidential elections in the United States. In the case of state-sponsored Internet propaganda, Marko Kovic defines this practice as "digital astroturfing", calling it "a form of manufactured, deceptive and strategic top-down activity on the Internet initiated by political actors that mimics bottom-up activity by autonomous individuals" [-@kovic_digital_2018, p.71].

Moreover, the *Alt-Right* (arguably the western counterparts to the Netto-Uyoku and associated primarily with the United States) have drawn much ire after a white nationalist terror attack[^29] (i.e. ideologically driven violence) in Charlottesville, Virginia during its Unite the Right rally, and again after little public disavowal by the President of the United States.[^24] In similar fashion and overlapping ideologically with the Alt-Right, we find associated foremost with (Western) Europe, Australia and New Zealand, the so-called *Identitarian Movement*. It should then be noted too that the perpetrator of the March 2019 terror attack in New Zealand sprinkled his manifesto with deeply ironic Internet culture rhetoric inherent to those movements.[^13] In Belgium, the mid-2019 elected politician Dries van Langenhove (aligned with populist far right party Vlaams Belang),[^31] acquired attention through his mimicry of rhetoric used by online-based far-right nationalist movements such as the Alt-Right on platforms as *Facebook* and gaming chat application *Discord*,[^25] as revealed in a 2018 documentary of notorious Identitarian youth movement *Schild & Vrienden*[^30].[^10] In France, the term *fachosphère* came to denote similar trends on the French Internet after *Le Monde* published a series of articles linking Marine Le Pen's populist far-right Front National, Online video-game community *jeuxvideo.com* and "Internet trolls" [@laurent_nordactu_2016;@audureau_les_2017].[^16] In South Korea, the populist far-right Liberty Korea Party (LKP) has been condemned for its usage of "online Internet trolls", its former chairman, presidential candidate and Youtuber Hong Joon-Pyo has seen comparisons to Donald Trump [@he-rim_firebrand_2018;@bo-gyung_youtube_2019], and the online platform *Ilbe Storage* is described as hosting the South Korean equivalent of the Japanese Netto-Uyoku [@shim_hardcore_2015]. 

If the actions of those online movements had any measurable effect on the outcome of the elections is wholly debatable, but in light of the above information, it is at the very least sensible to claim the Internet as a medium plays an undeniable role, not just in the organization of neo-nationalist movements, but in shaping elements of its discourse as well; a narrative that is by the way increasingly amplified by numerous mainstream news outlets.[^26] Furthermore, Japan's international *soft power* has without a doubt left its mark on many of those communities abroad, seeping particularly into the Alt-Right and Identitarian Movement.[^32] Former Donald Trump strategist and Breitbart News Network owner Steve Bannon, for example, was a speaker at the 2017 *Japanese Conservative Political Action Conference* (J-CPAC) and praised Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as being "Trump before Trump", while Alt-Right and Identitarian Movement associates as Richard Spencer (who coined the term Alt-Right) have praised Japan as being an exemplary *ethno-state*. Other such Alt-Right associates include for example the white supremacist author Jared Taylor (who was born in Japan and speaks fluent Japanese) and Vice Magazine co-founder and Proud Boys[^33] founder Gavin McInnes, who participated in a reenactment of the 1960 assassination of Japanese Socialist Party (JSP) chairman Inejiro Asanuma by ultra-nationalist Otoya Yamaguchi [@feuer_founder_2018].[^20] Journalist Audrea Lim, in her The New York times editorial, even goes so far to assert "yellow fever" (a sexual obsession with those of Asian descent) as a common trait amongst the Alt-Right, stating that many public figures in the movement have had documented relationships with Asian women [-@lim_opinion_2018].

This soft power influence is observable on a grass-roots level as well. [@charity_why_2016] states it is increasingly common to encounter images online of Japanese animation characters sporting political symbols ranging from neo-Nazi imagery to Trump-related iconography such as MAGA hats. The English-language anonymous messaging board *4chan* in particular,[^17] currently owned by *2channel* founder Hiroyuki Nishimura, started as a North-American copy of its Japanese equivalent *2channel*, with an intended focus on discussing Japanese pop-culture, but came under heavy scrutiny in 2014 for its association with the *Gamergate* controversy[^18] and the Alt-Right. Preliminary research on such microcosmic English-language Internet communities (such as the political discussion section of *4chan* and the conservative political section of *Reddit*)[^56] observe strong neo-nationalist rhetoric exemplary of the Alt-Right. Moreover, they argue these Internet communities to be hubs for influencing mainstream political discourse and setting "the narrative agenda for mainstream media outlets" [@hine_kek_2016; @pearson_scientists_2016; @zannettou_web_2017; @zannettou_origins_2018]. Alt-right appropriated *viral* imagery ("*memes*")[^19] such as that of a green anthropomorphic frog ("Pepe the Frog") find their roots in those communities, and have been shared in some form by members of the current White House, including Donald Trump and Donald Trump Jr. [@lee_understanding_2016; @ohlheiser_analysis_2016; @phillips_alt-right_2016]. 

Thus, to reiterate, an increase of mainstream news reports, as mentioned above, claim occidental online communities with an origin in discussing Japanese pop-culture to effectively be 1. hotbeds for right-wing radicalization, and 2. important electoral spaces for both right-wing populist political parties and for politically motivated citizen movements in the United States and Europe. Members of those movements have praised Japan as the ideal of an "ethno-state", and have themselves gained political traction outside the realm of the digital. Moreover, in this chapter I've discussed a global trend of neo-nationalist discourse on the Internet and shown that terms as *fachosphere*, Netto-Uyoku and Alt-Right are conceived of as expressions of such phenomena. Nevertheless the *fachosphere* for example refers uniquely to the French language cyberspace in which such a discourse finds place (with the added connotation of fascism), while the Alt-Right, now as a term unquestionably grown beyond its intended use, was originally conceived of as applying to a particular ideological movement in the United States. 

As I demonstrate in the next chapter, a common factor in literature on the Netto-Uyoku is the connection with ideologically driven ACM movements like the Zaitokukai (arguably the *real* counterpoint to the original Alt-Right). The term Netto-Uyoku however, leans in meaning most closely to this phenomenon of Internet-driven right-wing populist nationalism; a phenomenon I would like to further conceptualize as the ideological movement of *cyber-nationalism* (i.e. a form of neo-nationalism centered around the peculiarities of the Internet as a medium). Although overlapping with recent conceptualizations of neo-nationalism, I feel that the *neo* aspect does not yet permit enough agency to the Internet as a medium. After all, as McLuhan famously describes, "the medium is the message" (McLuhan 1964) and, with roots in libertarian counter-movements, so too is the Internet and World Wide Web (as I will delve into in the fourth chapter) undeniably political. Although rooted in technological determinism, McLuhan argued similarly to @azuma_ippan_2011, @tamura_niggling_2014 that the very nature of electronic media would shrink the world into a 'global village' and cause social change through increased social and political involvement and awareness. Precisely because of the general lack of gate-keepers and the dual role of the Internet-user as both consumer and producer does the the Internet as medium thus serve as perfect representation McLuhan's notion of 'global village'.[^21]

In this chapter, I've also argued that is a meaningful topic to research. The space of the Internet is increasingly politicized and fertile soil for both grass-roots level Internet activism and large-scale political warfare. Within the context of Internet and politics, academics and journalists alike have to various degrees debated and hypothesized on the contribution of the Internet to political polarization, on the Internet's utilization by political actors applying populist strategies and antagonizing mainstream press, and on the media effects of the so-called 'new media' on its users regarding political awareness and opinion-forming (such as the effects of so-called echo chambers).[^15] Although deliberate misinformation ("fake news") is by no means a new trend either,[^11] this too has thrived due to the Internet's widespread usage. The lack of moderation and the spontaneity of social network platforms facilitates the (conscious) spreading and sharing of false information (or information seen loose of its context), without reflection or without source control, and has potentially far-reaching political consequences. 

Thus, while this paper refrains from taking too hard a technological determinist position towards the Internet (the implication being that the existence of the Internet as new medium would by itself be a lead cause for societal change),[^22] and treats the Netto-Uyoku in part as a symptom of deeper cultural malaise, it does suggest that by no means should the Internet be dismissed as merely a tool of communication that is itself shaped by societal changes; two takes that both have often been reported in respects to the Netto-Uyoku and other cyber-nationalist movements (**sources here, news article claiming the Internet caused right-wing populism, and visa versa**). Nevertheless, in many ways I cover over the next chapter, populism, and ironically nationalism too, thrives through the Internet. Although the term Netto-Uyoku and its idiosyncrasies are in no doubt shaped by Japanese occurrences, as seen in the framing of more recent works I describe in the next chapter, I maintain that this phenomenon is a good starting point for conceptualizing a universally applicable notion of *cyber-nationalism*.

This paper consists of five chapters, including this introductory first chapter. The second chapter intents to built a narrative on the Netto-Uyoku through a literature review of both several seminal writings and studies, both in the English and Japanese language. As a relatively young and volatile term, 'Netto-Uyoku' has gone through shifts in meaning. Earlier works viewed the Netto-Uyoku not as an actual group with group identity, but loosely as people utilizing the Internet and engaging in aggressive, politically-driven (ultra-nationalist) rhetoric online (**Sources**). With the widespread pejorative usage of the term (in particular the abbreviation *netouyo*), those at the receiving end of this critique have had ambiguous reactions. Some denounced the term (a common thread is the normative implication that they are merely 'normal Japanese citizens' voicing the concerns of the people), while others have mockingly appropriated it (as is the case, for example, with Zaitokukai-founder Makoto Sakurai). Through the social constructionist act of naming this phenomenon, so thus arises a group identity with the discursive implication of both in-group normalization and out-group polarization. Early scholarly work referring to the Netto-Uyoku does so in a greater context debating politicians with populist tendencies (Toru Hashimoto, Shintaro Ishihara, Abe Shinzo), the revisionist organization Nippon Kaigi, or the actions of ACM-affiliated protest movements as Zaitokukai. The social platform of 2channel is however a red line throughout these works, as well as occasional references to Channel Sakurai, Niconico Doga, Youtube and Twitter. Those works have far often viewed the Netto-Uyoku in a greater debate of (trans)national identity, discrimination and of questions to what qualifies as freedom of speech [@tsuji_eng:_2008;@yasuda_eng:_2012;@yasuda_:_2013;@murai_net_2012;@morris-suzuki_beyond_2015]. State of the art literature in contrast discusses and hypothesize on the socio-cultural background of the Netto-Uyoku, as well as on its ideology, demography and *modus operandi* [@schafer_japans_2017;@kitada_owaranai_2018;@kurahashi_:_2018;@ota_saraba_2019;@yasuda_:_2019]. 

This paper then too intents to read the Netto-Uyoku not as a noisy fringe element of Japanese society, but as an ideologically driven movement with political agency, and keeping in the mind the context laid out in this chapter, the power to exert influence on public discourse. Based on this premise, several questions do come to mind. How then do the Netto-Uyoku and Japanese Internet sub-cultures fit in Japanese politics? Is there then a likelihood of radicalization amongst the Netto-Uyoku, with the offset chance of major political shifts or increases in politically-motivated violence, or is there just too great a difference between the socio-cultural context of the Netto-Uyoku and that of its equivalents worldwide to even imagine such events occurring? Are there similar trends of online culture wars on Japanese social media? I attempt to answer these in the next few chapters.

The third chapter serves to lay down a Frankfurt School inspired lens of theory through which I will read the Netto-Uyoku. In this chapter, I build a framework of cyber-nationalism based on my understanding of ideology, neo-nationalism and populism. I do this through the reasoning of thinkers associated with the Western Marxist or Frankfurt School of critical theory: György Lukács, Antonio Gramsci, Theodor W. Adorno, Walter Benjamin and Fredric Jameson—juxtaposing this with concrete historical applications leading up to the present state in which the Netto-Uyoku arises. In contextualizing populism, I follow @taggart_populism_2000, @laclau_populist_2005 and @mudde_oxford_2013 in their definitions of populism as a *thin-centered* ideology antagonizing a homogeneous elite in contrast to "the People's Will", a homogeneous group of "ordinary people", utilizing a "us versus them" dichotomy. It then further analyzes compatibility with a so-called "Japanese model of populism" (*nihongata popyurizumu* 日本型ポピュリズム) as described by Japanese scholars such as @otake__2003, @kimura__2006, Matsutani Mitsuru [-@matsutani__2009; -@matsutani_eng:_2010], @yoshida__2011, and @kobori_populism_2013. I also draw on the work of @anderson_imagined_2006 for his notion of *imagined communities* and Azuma Hiroki for his concepts of *General Will 2.0* in relation to Internet-based forms of populism, and *animalization* within the context of Lukács's *reification* [-@azuma_otaku:_2001;-@azuma_ippan_2011].

In the fourth and fifth chapter I attempt to lay bare underlying ideological structures by conducting a critical discourse analysis (CDC) of the Netto-Uyoku. I will first give a brief overview on the development of the Internet, both on a global scale and on its implementation in Japan. Next, I analyze the development of digital communities and online discourse on the Japanese Internet. While the Internet's transnational means of communication are of critical importance to \nth{21} century globalism, the Internet does not exist in a void and even its very creation is political in nature. When itself seen as a cultural artifact, the cultural background of Japan infer a different logistical implementation of the Internet when compared to the United States, giving rise to different expression of the Internet in daily life. Finally, I contrast discourse on communities associated with Netto-Uyoku (such as 2channel and Niconico) with more mainstream platforms such as Youtube and Twitter, where I draw the bulk of my dataset. Keeping in mind McLuhanian logic, I pay particular attention to the *modus operandi* of each platform as well as peculiarities of the Internet itself. Support for Japanese characters on Internet addresses (URLs) is for example relatively new, and thus are Japanese website URLs and many profile names on social made dominantly written in the Latin alphabet (in the process hinting at a technologically-determined hegemonic nature of the medium).

Finally, the fifth chapter builds on one particular event in recent Netto-Uyoku history: The Netto-Uyoku Ban Festival (*netouyo ban matsuri *ネトウヨBAN祭り). Earlier I inquired on the existence of a Japanese equivalent of online culture wars. While setting up the outline of my paper, this question answered itself. The latter uses methods of mass-reporting on Youtube and Twitter for automatic removal of Netto-Uyoku related accounts. With a quantitative approach I attempt to prove that the focus of those labeled Netto-Uyoku has (not unlike the 'Left versus Right' wars as perceived elsewhere) shifted away from the traditional targets of Korea as the cultural other. For this, I built a library of Netto-Uyoku-related keywords which I categorize according to a typology based on my definition of cyber-nationalism. 

Over the course of this paper, I attempt to answer such questions as:

- What is the demography of the Netto-Uyoku movement?
- How should we define Netto-Uyoku ideology, if at all present in Netto-Uyoku rhetoric?
- How do the Netto-Uyoku ideologically compare to the ultra-nationalist Uyoku Dantai?
- What processes do Netto-Uyoku employ to disseminate ideology?
- What are the dynamic processes of the media platforms that the Netto-Uyoku utilize?
- How do Netto-uyoku compare to other online-based neo-nationalist movements? Can we speak of a distinct Japanese character compared to contemporary movements, or should we view Netto-Uyoku primarily as part of a greater trend of Internet-fueled populist neo-nationalism? Secondly, is there a common reaction to, for example, the Alt-Right and Trump-era politics?
- How does the movement organize and mobilize, both online and in real life?
- Is there possible space for furthering a Netto-Uyoku political "agenda" through influencing its international counterparts?

Finally, it should be mentioned that any research involving the Internet and social networks online is bound to have some risks and limitations. In this case risks and limitations involve liquidity of data, copyright laws pertaining acquiring data and lack of reliability due anonymity masking intent of the original author.[^57] As I referred to earlier, one issue that arose during my writing process was the effect of an on-going online *culture war* between Netto-Uyoku members and anti-hate speech movements. I concur that limiting public access to ideological extremist material reduces chances of radicalization,[^55] but for the purposes of research it drastically impacted my ability to assess network influence and trickle-down affects of extremist rhetoric on mainstream platforms. Other issues are the extraction of online data from an ethical viewpoint and the concept of informed consent, more so in light of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The dataset contains data created independent of the researcher (or as *Doing Qualitative Research Online* author @salmons_doing_2016 puts it, an *extant* method), on platforms that are either explicitly open (Youtube, 2channel, Reddit, *matome* blogs, Twitter and *wiki*-style encyclopedias) or that is publicly accessible once logged in with a profile (public figures on Facebook, Niconico). In other words, data that is openly available to group-outsiders and explicitly intended to be so (including user-names) on online spaces that are not expected to be private spaces. With the ratification of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)[^47] on 25 May 2018, 2channel has blocked all access from EU IP addresses. All data was however legally obtained during my presence in Japan, and according to the Terms of Service of platforms I have an account on. Finally, following Janet Salmons argument for a synthesis between different traditions on research ethics, it is therefore reasonable to argue that informed consent from the researcher is not applicable in this case.

#The Phenomenology of Netto-Uyoku ー A Literature Review

To demonstrate the extent of reach the Netto-Uyoku have had, this paper's introduction briefly touched upon an English-language print article in The New York Times. It goes without saying the term has been in use since much earlier. The first English-language mention in mainstream media can be traced back to March. 14, 2006, when Journalist Eric Johnston wrote a piece for The Japan Times on right-wing nationalism and the Internet in Japan, "Net boards venue for faceless rightists". In his piece, Johnston associates these 'faceless rightists' (who he further refers to as *Net Uyoku*) with hate-speech towards Koreans, the anonymous Internet forum *2Channel*, online video platform *Channel Sakura* and the conservative political organization *Nippon Kaigi* [@johnston_net_2006]. These topics are presented to some extent in virtually all writings I will review. 
In Japan, the term first reached print press in a 2005 Mainichi Shimbun article by @sasaki_netto-uyoku_2005, a journalist with a lengthy publishing record on Japanese Internet discourse. Almost two decades have passed since its first usage in mainstream press and almost a decade since the journalist @yasuda_eng:_2012 brought the phenomenon in connection to the

#Cybernationalism and Japan - Connecting the Dots

In chapter one, I've suggested that the Netto-Uyoku adhere ideologically to a form of right-wing populist nationalism (which I'll further refer to as neo-nationalism). I've further argued that media and this current wave of populism sweeping the world are intrinsically linked. Finally, we can from the very meaning of the Japanese term Netto-Uyoku (the 'Internet Right') draw an implied importance of the Internet and social media. These loaded statements inevitably lead to several challenges. As it is, concepts as ideology, populism and nationalism (along with such terms as freedom and democracy) are due their over-inflation in usage at an increasing risk of becoming neigh reduced to trending political abstractions; or to borrow from Laclau's [-@laclau_populist_2005, p.70] theorization of semiotics and political identity, empty signifiers. 

Secondly, without specifically defining these terms in a universal way applicable to a Japanese context (if at all possible), *such loaded statements lead to the pitfall of judging a phenomenon by my own sets of values, rooted in my western upbringing. Populism in particular, due its renewed interest as a field of study in political science, deserves a closer look. The question remains if these concepts can be defined in a universally applicable way without succumbing to the pitfalls of sociological positivism or ahistorical structuralism.* **rewrite**

##Discourse, Power, Ideology

"1. A system of ideas and ideals, especially one which forms the basis of economic or political theory and policy. 2. The set of beliefs characteristic of a social group or individual", thus defines the online Oxford Dictionary ideology.[^36] Although Terry Eagleton in his *Ideology: An Introduction* [-@eagleton_ideology:_1991] agrees that such a pragmatic view on the notion of ideology is common in public discourse (albeit with the possibility of an underlying critique: that of the ideologue having an an oversimplified view of the world, and through indoctrination has a distorted understanding of reality), he does warn, in light of the historical context briefly sketched below, against one "Grand Global Theory" or one single comprehensive definition of ideology; especially one that would contrast ideology with "pragmatism". After all, following Martin Heidegger's hermeneutic reasoning of interpreting reality, it would be impossible to identify and judge an occurrence without a set of preconceived values. Or following Mannheim's Paradox, analyzing a world-view as an ideology is achieved only from the vantage point of another ideology [-@eagleton_ideology:_1991: p.1, pp221-224].

Actions of the Netto-Uyoku are, intentional or not, ideologically motivated. By studying the discourse and rhetoric of the Netto-Uyoku, we can uncover the underlying ideological mechanisms of the Netto-Uyoku, and by unearthing these processes, we can then understand how its discourse is formed. Keeping in mind Mannheim's Paradox, that this paper too is ideologically predisposed,[^50] a critical reading of the Netto-Uyoku's discourse and ideological stances could help to unravel any contradictions in, and give more insight of, greater social trends facing our world today.

###Conceptualizing ideology

Conceptualization of ideology has known many approaches. Historically, the concept finds its roots in the French Revolution as a positivist attempt to develop a new scientific framework of Enlightenment ideas ('the discourse of patterns'), a form of skeptical scientific materialism [@eagleton_ideology:_1991: p.70]. Following Napoleon's attack of the French "ideologues" as, in @mudde_oxford_2013 (**Page number**)'s words, "unrealistic escapism and philosophical reverie", ideology has since gone through several shifts in meaning. From a classical Marxist view, as interpreted by @eagleton_ideology:_1991, ideology too represented a false or misleading awareness of the human situation. Ideology was however to be understood as an instrument of those in control of the means of production. That is to say, steering—whether intentional or not—the economically subservient class away from a scientific, objective reality (and hence from what is in the best interests of the dominated class) with a *false consciousness*, of one's ability to self-identify as an economic class and express a political will. Hence  maintaining the equilibrium this mode of production.[^3] In other words, classical Marx' materialist theory places ideology as a superstructure in contrast to reality within an economic, dialectic basis-superstructure relationship. The dominant ideology is tied directly to the base, the mode of production, and visa-versa. On the precondition of being universally applicable, we might then for example view the *kokutai* (国体) notion or state-Shintoism to be ideological means for morally *justifying* exploitation[^38] (perhaps viewing the *zaibatsu* conglomerate as part of a Japanese *bourgeoisie*)[^54], while in contrast during the era of the 'Economic Miracle', the ideologies of economical growth and the *nihonjinron* (日本人論) breed of ethnocentric nationalism would then function to deprive of or obscure from the subservient class the objective reality; thus maintaining or legitimizing the *status quo* of society and its economic structures of exploitation.[^37] This line of thinking is however economically determinist. Furthermore, failure of Marx' proposed collapse of capitalist society betrays its rigid scientism. after all, despite hints of a Taisho-era democracy we cannot pinpoint an exact bourgeois revolution within the transition from feudalism to capitalism in Japan. 

Forward, Karl Mannheim approached ideology as dynamic and being shaped both by the unconscious assumptions guiding our lives on a *psychological* level, and by our (social group's) position within social structures, on a *social* level. This Marxist interpretation of history *itself* was an ideology. So too changed the pejorative notion of ideology; and grew the idea of a 'positive' ideology to counter class oppression [@van_dijk_politics_2006;@mudde_oxford_2013: ch.1,ch.3]. Since the early writings on ideology, and with sociological developments such as the *liguistic turn*, ideology as a concept has seen a wide range of meanings, deeply entangled with the study of discourse, culture and politics [@mudde_oxford_2013: ch.1], with contributions made by amongst others Marxist scholars Louis Althusser, Georg Lukács (*theory of reification*) and Antonio Gramsci (*theory of hegemony*), as well as Michel Foucault and members of the Frankfurt School. Contributions that have helped develop the relation between the Marxist notion of ideology and the fields of culture and communication. In his approach to ideology critique, Eagleton recapitulates top down from its most general to its most specific usage, in six points the different epistemological perspectives on ideology [@eagleton_ideology:_1991, pp.28-30; @fuchs_racism_2018, pp.158-159]. let us then observe the following list:

1. Ideology as the "the general material processes of production of ideas, beliefs, and values in social life" and "the whole complex of signifying practices and symbolic processes in a particular society" [@eagleton_ideology:_1991, p28]. In other words, a neutral, descriptive definition of ideology as *culture*.
2. Ideology as the "ideas and beliefs" of a "specific, socially significant group or class" as "a kind of collective symbolic self-expression" [@eagleton_ideology:_1991, p29]. In other words, ideology as a neutral *world-view*.
3. Ideology as the "promotion and legitimation of particular interests [...] in the face of opposing interests" and as rhetorical discourse, a "discursive field in which self-promoting social powers conflict and collide over questions central to the reproduction of social power as a whole" [@eagleton_ideology:_1991, p29]. In this definition, ideology begins to be seen in relational, conflictive terms.
4. Like 3, the "promotion and legitimation of sectoral interests" but by "a dominant social power". This perhaps in order to "*unify* a social formation in ways convenient for its rulers [...] securing the complicity of subordinated classes and groups" [@eagleton_ideology:_1991, pp29-30]. This definition refines the third definition
5. Like 4, "ideas and beliefs which help to legitimate the interests of a ruling group or class" but specifically through "distortion and dissimulation" [@eagleton_ideology:_1991, p30].
6. False or deceptive beliefs[^39] "arising not from the interests of a dominant class but from the material structure of society as a whole" [@eagleton_ideology:_1991, p30], such as Marx's theory of commodity fetishism. The economic base determines the superstructure of ideology.

###Gramsci, Lukács and Althusser

The epistemologically neutral definitions we have seen courtesy of the Oxford Dictionary fit in the first two descriptions given above, while the last three are akin the Marxist tradition; the last one in particular relating to so-called *vulgar* or economically reductionist Marxism. In these, power is a zero-sum game. The dominant possession of power invariably reduces the power of the subservient class. With that in mind, and for importance to this thesis, are the next generation of Marxists: Gramsci, Lukács and Althusser—three crucial thinkers in expanding Marxist theory on ideology. 

    Building on the concept of false consciousness, Lukács theorized class consciousness as a class-bound ideology obtained through class-level self-awareness, the result of *reification*. *Reification* meaning the alienation of the self and a fragmented understanding of the totality, in wake of Marx's notion of commodity fetishism an commodification of labor [@eagleton_ideology:_1991, pp.94-99]. 

After a failed communist uprising in Italy and in order to explain the failure of Marx' conception of the inevitable proletarian revolution, Gramsci recognized culture (or cultural *soft* power) as an important factor not sufficiently taken in account for in traditional Marxist theory. Gramsci views the state as a superstructure consisting of a *political society* and a *civil society*, an *integral state* in which the latter is an essential component for maintaining consent and the former is a means to coerce and discipline those who don't consent.[^52] Furthermore, Gramsci coins the notion of *cultural hegemony*, arguing that consent to the rule of the governing class is a manufactured outcome of socialization and promulgation of ideology.[^48] More specifically, promulgation through social institutions within the public sphere of civil society: education, organized religion, the media industry, and the entertainment industry. While the civil society is in modern capitalist nations formally not under control of the political society (notwithstanding that Japan is ranked 67th in the 2019 World Press Freedom Index[^44]), they serve to impose the state's dominant set of values as "common sense": the values of the dominant class become accepted as that society in general. Predominance of the ruling class by coercion is in contrast restricted to the level of political society, which includes institutions as the government, police, judicial system and army. In a modern capitalist state however, civil society and *soft* power have grown to such an extent that this "legitimized violence" has to certain degrees answer to public consent; which again can be achieved through the dominant ideology. Yet, if contradictions in the dominant ideology are too great, the manufacturing of consent becomes unsustainable. In other words, this leads to a *hegemonic crisis*. 

For Althusser, ideology was an *unconscious*, discursive and material process; assimilated and reproduced through cultural practices in the ideological state apparatus; with little space for human agency. Gramsci does however see room for this in civil society. For Gramsci, ideology does have value. He further coins the concept of *subaltern* (a term crucial in post-colonial studies)[^40] to refer not just to those lacking in economical and political power (such as peasants and the proletariat), but those whose very cultural or social identity is on the fringes of the dominant ideology. Those whose history is overshadowed by that of the ruling class and who are denied the rights to making one's own culture and historical narratives. Yet in these fringes is an opening to develop a subaltern consciousness, a subculture. For revolution to be successful, it is therefore first necessary for those groups to dismantle the cultural hegemony by developing one's own organic ideology (a dialectic process of an "ideological struggle" with the hegemonic ideologies) unifying a 'collective will' as class-consciousness and producing a counter-hegemony. Only after ascertaining a counter-hegemonic dominance on civil society could the subservient classes succeed in coercive action over the political society [@gramsci_selections_1985: p.47, pp.210-238].[^41] Gramsci calls this *passive revolution* [@gramsci_selections_1985, pp106-120]. In the case of a crisis of hegemony as mentioned above, the dominant class has no means but to either rely on coercion through the political society, or to consolidate oppositional movements in civil society (the passive revolution).

Ideology for Gramsci is a specific historical phenomenon (a "historicist" approach in contrast to "scientific" Marxism) and observable both on a micro- and macro-scale. Ideology as a "lived, habitual social practice" on an individual level "the unconscious, inarticulate dimensions of social experience" and on a collective level that of social institutions [@eagleton_ideology:_1991, p115]. Perry Anderson[^43] builds on this. Whereas Gramsci locates cultural hegemony in civil society alone, Anderson finds hegemony in political society, "for the political form of the capitalist state is itself a vital organ of such power", and reasons that the institutions of civil society play a complementary role to hegemony [@eagleton_ideology:_1991, pp.112-113].[^42] So too does Marxist theorist Raymond Williams (Eagleton's mentor) expand on Gramsci's notion of hegemony as being dynamic, in constant need of renewal and modification, struggling for dominance and unlike ideology inseparable from struggle [@eagleton_ideology:_1991, pp.115].

Some concrete examples of this reasoning. If orthodox Marxism were to view the contradictory nature of increasing student debt in the United Stages and the ideological narratives of neo-liberal capitalism[^51] as a trigger for working class awareness and the inevitable overthrow of capitalism, then in Gramsci's interpretation, civil society would be the stage for counter-hegemonic processes in passive revolution. 2011 saw widespread resentment directed at Wall Street in the populist Occupy Wall Street, with ideological slogans as "We are the 99%" [@rehmann_bernie_2016]. In 2019, politicians Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are running on a counter-hegemonic platform to cancel student debt. Likewise, although the democratic impact of the 1994 electoral system reforms in Japan is questionable considering the near constant dominance of the Liberal Democrat Party on national politics since [@komatsu_first_2017], the 1993 Japanese general election and fall of the 1955 system[^53] could also be read through this lens. 

Although not explicitly referring to Gramsci or Marxist traditions of ideology, the language of @dower_peace_1993 in his narrative assessment of the New Left and late '60 political movements certainly seem to suggest such logic as well. As Dower states, the growth of Japan as a cultural and economical powerhouse brought to light contradictions in society—the *San Francisco System*, the ambiguous position of Okinawa and environmental issues (mercury poisoning in Minamata), to name a few—pitting "liberal and left-wing critics against the dominant conservative elites" and introducing "a more radical anti-imperialist critique to the discourse on peace and democracy.". In light of rapid economical growth, hegemonic ideologies of nationalism, capitalism, peace and democracy retained a strong grip on public consent, or as @dower_peace_1993 puts it, the "conservative hegemony-the bedrock of the 1955 System-continued to rule japan" [@dower_peace_1993, pp.5-6,p.21]. Nevertheless this counter-hegemonic shakes society in the late '60s.

>"It is estimated that between 1967 and 1970 alone, more than eighteen million Japanese took to the streets to protest the war in Vietnam and demand the reversion of Okinawa to Japan. Uncounted others were involved in the university struggles and citizens' movements against the ravages of the growth-oriented state. As elsewhere, "people's power" entered the Japanese lexicon at this time as a legitimate and essential alternative to bourgeois parliamentary politics; and, as elsewhere, the theory and practice of "people's power" ranged from peaceful protest to wanton violence. By the mid-1970s the nationwide people's movement was moribund, but it left as legacies the memory and experience of grass-roots mobilization that could be evoked in more particularistic causes thereafter."

\chapter*{Conclusion}

In my introductory first chapter, I've made the argument that the Internet has seen increasing politicization; ranging from populist usage of big-data and paid propaganda campaigns operating as *faux* grassroots activism, to microcosmic counter-culture subcultures in the West; primarily built around the discussion of Japanese pop-culture and disrupting the public discourse on political issues. Furthermore, I brought up the topic of online culture wars. While a lack of seemingly similar culture wars in Japan could be seen as a sign that the political shift of such subcultures as that on *4chan*'s political board reflects larger social trends within the United States and/or Europe and leaves little space for media agency, I tend to believe culture is a feedback loop and at the very least the political rhetoric utilized in this public discourse finds its roots in the particular culture developed in those communities. *Regardless, in Japan too have the Netto-Uyoku, the decentralized populist right-wing nationalist (that is, cyber-nationalist) voice on the Japanese Internet, shaken to some extent public discourse on politics, and can their rhetoric be traced back to those subcultures.*

In that chapter I next listed several questions I intended to answer during this paper:

- What is the demography of the Netto-Uyoku movement?
- How should we define Netto-Uyoku ideology?
- How do the Netto-Uyoku compare to the ultra-nationalist Uyoku Dantai?
- What processes do the Netto-Uyoku employ to disseminate ideology?
- What are the dynamic processes of the media platforms that the Netto-Uyoku utilize?
- How do the Netto-uyoku compare to other online-based neo-nationalist movements? Can we speak of a distinct Japanese character compared to contemporary movements, or should we view the Netto-Uyoku primarily as part of a greater trend of Internet-fueled populist neo-nationalism? Secondly, is there a common reaction to, for example, the Alt-Right and Trump-era politics?
- How does the movement organize and mobilize, both online and in real life?
- Is there possible space for furthering a Netto-Uyoku political "agenda" through influencing its international counterparts?

The term Netto-Uyoku was coined fifteen years ago. In my second chapter I've reviewed a select amount of literature both from the early period covering the Netto-Uyoku as a fringe element of greater topics, to more recent literature covering the Netto-Uyoku and the internet.

In the third chapter, I've attempted to map the ideology behind the right-wing reactionary voices utilizing the Internet drawing on Frankfurt School scholars' theorization of ideology and media. It is a pitfall to apply theory rooted in western cultural traditions without balancing the different socio-cultural contexts of the subject, and arguments too could be made against the continuous western hegemony of academia. Yet, when we follow Anderson's and McLuhan's logic on media and literacy as crucial to nationalism, and see the world as a 'global village' connected by the digital, it wouldn't be a far stretch to consider the universal nature of the concepts presented in this chapter.

While I could never claim information warfare, populist demagoguery or nationalism to be new tactics in politics, it is not far-fetched to claim this is now done to great success on the Internet; fueled by both the technological peculiarities of the Internet itself (algorithms etc) and the rhetoric formed on Internet subcultures. In the fourth chapter I've covered the development of Japanese Internet subcultures and the close ties of Otaku culture with the adaption of the Internet.

https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanhatesthis/brazil-jair-bolsonaro-facebook-elections

In the third chapter, I've found many of the ideological goals of the Netto-Uyoku to fall in line with that of the current administration, who've in turn done well in dog-whistling to the Netto-Uyoku. This could be interpreted as one reason for a lack of political success for the Netto-Uyoku-associated Makoto Sakurai and his Japan First Party.

I conclude that the Netto-Uyoku, like its counterparts across the world, is on one hand a continuation of an ideological war 


Whereas the rise in global right-wing populism shook the world in 2016, which falls in line with the wide-spread counter-hegemonic narrative disseminated in part by cyber-nationalists, I've argued that this has appeared much earlier in Japan. More specifically in an outburst of public outrage after events occurring around 2011: scandals in politics, public media and the 2011 Fukushima Nuclear Disaster (as suggested on page \pageref{populism-gt} by **Figure \ref{fig:politictrends}**). *Interest*[^23] in politics has taken an increasingly large relative share of Google searches across the world. In Japan, interest has remained relatively stable with the exception of a massive peak in 2011; A massive peak we've noted by the way on **Figure \ref{fig:nettouyoku}** (page \pageref{nettouyoku-gt}).

Following various contradictions in post-war Japan's society, The New Left and student protests influenced by Marxist scholars shook civil society. Now, anti-intellectual right-wing populists are (sub-)consciously applying the same Marxist school of thought. Contradictions in society, most notably the effects of alienation in the wake of the Lost Decades, have renewed public distrust. Within this sphere of alienation and crises of identity, digital natives built intrinsic cyber-communities with a distinct anti-establishment discourse—a cyber-discourse with vast ties to the libertarian mindset that shaped the ideology behind the Internet in the first place. 

As we see happening across the world, I argued these communities to be ripe for political exploitation (in the form of a potential political electorate) by those same right-wing populists. Whether its Donald Trump's presidential campaigns, Duterte in the Phillipines or the Flemish right-wing populist Vlaams Belang in 2019, right-wing populists have since the second half of the 2010's gained considerable support throughout the world by including digital natives in their campaign strategies. Distinct from national-scale politics in the United States however, I conclude that in Japan the current iteration of the LDP administration has successfully capitalized on this public distress. Although perceived societal contradictions up to the '90's shook the core of the LDP strong enough to bring about a massive reform of the voting system, I next argued that from the '90's onwards societal contradictions between the 'hegemonic ideology' and the perceived reality (seen to its inevitable conclusion following the 2011 Fukushima Nuclear Disaster and the reveal of the North Korean kidnappings) brought about a new iteration of the LDP, or rather one that answered to the counter-hegemonic narrative of the Japanese cyber-nationalists. The actions of the Netto-Uyoku and the Zaitokukai have let to *public* disavowal by Abe Shinzo, yet on social media the prime minister uses *dog-whistling* methods to appeal to those groups by expanding (**op inspelen**) upon those groups' rising concerns and antagonizing enemies on common ground: established forms of media, conservation of the ethnic-Japanese identity, and hostile positions towards both Korea's and China. Perhaps in this sense Steve Bannon had a point after all?

Finally I've demonstrated a higher awareness of group identity amongst those who reject the Netto-Uyoku. If the Netto-Uyoku exist and are to be named, then those who have become aware of this phenomenon and feel rejection form a group identity too, both in the off-line public sphere as on the Internet. Offline we have of course various counter protests such as SealDs, C.R.A.C. and influenced by its Western counterparts, the Antifa. Online we have seen communities form around exposing and removing Netto-Uyoku means of radicalization (I refer in particular to the 2018 - 2019 Netouyo Ban Festival). It is forebearing to claim, but perhaps this too can be seen as a trend of greater political shifts?

The web-portal *Yahoo! Japan* (a joint venture between the American Yahoo! and Son Masayoshi's SoftBank) retains a monopolistic grip on the Japanese Internet market as its most visited website. Nevertheless, as seen on **Figure \ref{fig:searchengine}**, Google is by far the dominant search engine, more so when taken in account Yahoo! Japan's search engine has since 2010 implemented Google's search engine algorithms (which may account for its increase in market share since). Results based on Google's statistics can therefore be argued to effectively reflect the overall interest of Internet users in Japan.

[^16]:  In the second article, @laurent_nordactu_2016 describes the *fachosphère* as part of the Identitarian Movement and "une nébuleuse de sites, de comptes sur les réseaux sociaux, visant à diffuser de la « réinformation », en clair de la propagande allant dans le sens des militants qui les animent", a nebula of websites and accounts on social networks, designed to disseminate "réinformation" or in other words propaganda embracing the ideas of the activists, amongst the users of those platforms.
[^17]:  Since its launch in 2003 4chan has been commonly accredited with popularizing many aspects now common to Internet communities. The message-board has several sections devoted to Japanese pop-culture, and in 2019 claimed over 27,700,000 unique visitors per month.Of note is the self-assessed demography of its users, consisting of a a mostly millennial, male user-base from the United States and Western Europe, listing interests as "Japanese culture, anime, manga, video games, comics, technology, music, movies" [@noauthor_advertise_nodate; @ellis_4chan_2018].
[^18]: A co-ordinated and reactionary harassment campaign against women targeting sexism in video game culture and the multi-billion video game industry, the Gamergate Controversy can be interpreted as a culture war against diversification of a supposed gamer identity (a cultural identity that has traditionally been associated with men). The controversy has had widespread coverage, including condemnation by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and was extensively covered by Alt-Right key-figure Milo Yiannopoulos on the far-right website Breitbart News Network. The outcome of this campaign has been claimed to have had radicalizing effects amongst its supporters [@wofford_is_2014; @johnston_chat_2014;@morgan_analysis_2016; @martens_rally_2017].
[^20]: It should be noted that a short news-report on Youtube covering this topic, "A Lot Of White Supremacists Seem To Have An Asian Fetish (HBO)" by @vice_news_lot_2017, had as of writing, a ratio of 6,1K dislikes to 5,6K likes. The author identified a newly posted comment by "Notification Email" (barring a play-list of game-related videos an otherwise empty account) to state "absolute state of (((modern journalism))) ... the truth is people longing culture about sincerity, chivalry, family value, etc. the west is beyond saved from the sinner, hedonist, liar, and degenerate." Another comment, by the account "ShadyxFiascoX 32", had 166 likes and stated "Personally Hitler loved Japan and said they had a good culture. What the hell is (((Vice))) talking about". In both cases the triple parentheses (originated from Alt-Right discourse) implies Jewish ownership of the video's owner, Vice News. One comment, by "Ochiai's Channel" misinterprets this video's content by posting "I am Japanese, and can I consider his talk as a hate speech against us?!". His channel, with a follower count of 610 subscribers and viewed over 87K times as of writing, states both in Japanese and English *2-Channeru-nado ni katte ni rinku o iron'na tokoro ni hattari,nan nara katte ni bideo o ichibu o kiritotte riyō suru no, OKdesu! ... Tada, han'nichi no hitotachi wa, do no yōna katachideare, riyō wa okotowarishimasu.* (「２ちゃんねる等に勝手にリンクを色んな所に貼ったり、なんなら勝手にビデオを一部を切り取って利用するの、OKです！ ... ただ、反日の人達は、どのような形であれ、利用はお断りします。」) and "You can paste my videos anywhere, or you can even download it and edit to use it. ... However, if you're anti-Japan or pro-migration, you're not welcome to do any of those in any means" [@noauthor_ochiais_nodate].
[^21]: It is fitting too then that former Vice President of the United States, Al Gore, referred to the Internet in a 1994 speech for the International Telecommunication Union, as "information superhighways" that would serve as a "metaphor of democracy" and lead to a "gobal community".

[^22]: "Determinism is a philosophical system that posits every physical event, including human cognition and action, is causally determined by an unbroken chain of past occurrences and therefore makes it possible for us to know future effects with certainty. Technological determinism claims that technology is an autonomous, "self-controlling, self-determining, self-generating, self-propelling, self-propelling, selfperpetuating and self-expanding force ... out of human control, changing under its own momentum and 'blindly' shaping society" [@chandler_act_1995, p.1]

He claims that "disturbing as the voice of cyber-extremism may be, its influence on Japanese politics and society remains limited, and its heyday is nearing an end" [@furuya_roots_2016].
[^25]: In another note-worthy intersection with the Alt-Right, Vlaams Belang leader Tom Van Grieken hosted an event debating the UN migration compact with amongst others Steve Bannon [@gotev_vlaams_2018]. Moreover, a youth subdivision of Vlaams Belang hosted Lauren Southern (see footnote 13) as guest-speaker during another congress supervised by Van Grieken [@rennenberg_vlaams_2018].

[^24]: After the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, The term Alt-Lite occasionally came into usage to differentiate its relatively moderate members from more extremist white-nationalist Alt-Right members such as Richard Spencer. When referring to the Alt-Right in this paper, this author uses the term as an overarching umbrella term indicating both. For a closer take on the Alt-Right, the Alt-Light and the "Online culture wars", this author recommends @nagle_kill_2017.
[^26]: One Politico reporter in an in-depth take on this states "Just about everyone else, if they’re aware of these efforts at all, assumes they amounted to little more than entertainment for bored geeks and some unpleasant episodes for the targets of its often racist and sexist harassment campaigns. After all, the idea that a swarm of socially alienated trolls played a meaningful role in a multibillion-dollar presidential campaign by, among other gambits, relentlessly spreading images of a cartoon frog is at least as ridiculous as the idea that a billionaire TV entertainer could win that campaign" [@schreckinger_world_nodate] . For other mainstream news examples, see The New York Times' *How The Trolls Stole Washington* [-@hess_how_2017] and Washington Post's *We Actually Elected A Meme As President* [@ohlheiser_analysis_2016].
[^27]: A news aggregation and discussion platform. Based on combined page views and unique visitors it is, according to Alexa Internet, as of June 2019 the \nth{16} most visited global website. Within the list of social media platforms it is preceded only by Youtube, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, as well as the Chinese web portals Tencent QQ and Sohu [@noauthor_alexa_nodate].

[^31]: Growing to become the second largest party in Belgium in the 2019 elections, Vlaams Belang (Flemish Interest)'s online campaign took inspiration from both the 2016 Brexit and Trump campaign, investing almost solely on social media advertisements and heavily targeting young voters aged 18 to 34 [@cerulus_inside_2019].
[^32]: Although affinity for Japan by the Far Right is of course by no means a new phenomenon. In 2010 for example, a European delegation including previous French Front National leader Jean-Marie Le Pen and Belgian Vlaams Belang associate and European Parliament member Phillip Claeys, visited the politically controversial Yasukuni Shrine reportedly on invitation by the far-right *Uyoku Dantai* issuikai [@k.c._how_2010;@phillips_bnp_2010]. 
[^33]: A far-right male-only organization driven by the white genocide conspiracy theory and notorious for inciting violence. Gavin McInnes has since gone on to write for the Canadian far-right Internet media-platform The Rebel Media.
[^34]: I've contrasted the term 'Netto-Uyoku' as a 'Topic' (which includes related keywords collected through neural networks) with the literal search terms '*netto-uyoku*' 「ネット右」 and '*netouyo*' 「翼ネトウヨ」. Interest indicates relative interest to the full amount of searches at that time, it is not an indicator of quantity. The highest value (100) represents the highest proportion of search results with all other results calculated in proportion. For more information on the methodology behind Google Trends, I refer to **\ref{appendix:googletrends}**.
[^35]: Although these worldwide trends reflect similar trends in Japan, they are preceded with a short massive spike of interest in both July 2011 and August 2012, suggesting the concept of populism to have penetrated the Japanese public lexicon period a fair bit earlier as on a global scale. A period, barely a year after the devastating 2011 Tōhoku earthquake in which political outsiders Shintaro Ishihara and Hashimoto Taro are making headlines, current prime minister Abe Shinzo was staging his political comeback, Tsuneo Watanabe, who was once called Japan's most powerful media baron [@onishi_shadow_2006], publishes a book warning against the dangers of populist nationalism (@watanabe_anti-populism_2012), and literary critic Azuma Hiroki gains renewed success with his publication of *ippan-ishi 2.0* (General Will 2.0, 一般意志2.0).
[^36]: <https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/ideology>
[^37]: "The term ideology, which had originally indicated a new science, became a condescending catch-word that served to demarcate political enemies. Ideology and ideologue began to connote the unwarranted interference of philosophical theory in political practices"[ @mudde_oxford_2013, p:19]. These shifts are still on-going in today's political discourse and the term is often used in a dichotomous relationship to the truth or to a "moderate position" such as pragmatism. One recent piece by the USA political think tank Niskanen Center, for example, uses the terms ideologues and extremists interchangeably [@niskanen_center_if_2019], while a 2016 Business Insider article paraphrases Barack Obama as calling Donald Trump pragmatic rather than ideological, "someone who is stringently tied to a political philosophy" [@darcy_obama_2016] and Donald Trump, at the 73rd Session of the United Nations General Assembly, announced his rejectal of the "ideology Of globalism" [@schwartz_trump_2018]. 
[^38]: Ironically, this fits well to the Alt-Right and Netto-Uyoku-appropriated conspiracy theories of "red-pilling" and "waking up" (*kakusei* 覚醒 or *mesameru* 目覚める, a concept Furuya Tsunehiro calls a matrix-historical viewpoint, *matorikksu-shikan* 「マトリックス史観」). This is a reference to the main character of 1999 science fiction film The Matrix who, after consuming a red pill, wakes up to reality, realizing humanity is being used as enslaved sources of energy for empowering a large machine. The idea is that someone who is red-pilled becomes aware of a Marxist left-wing elite utilizing their cultural hegemony over media to brainwash and exploit the ordinary people into believing a fabricated world-view. This very notion is of course unapologetic Marxist in nature. 
[^39]: These include statements that are not false *persé* but just as well  (EXTEND ON THIS PART)
[^40]: In post-colonial theory, the concept of the subaltern refers to those in the margins of colonial society, lacking of agency and being forced to resort to speak the colonial oppressor's language. Crucial early works on the topic include Edward Said's *Orientalism* (1978) and Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak's deconstructive essay *Can the Subaltern Speak?* (1983), which criticizes the practice of interpreting the Other through western methodology. Something I feel I am guilty of, writing this very paper on Japanese *digital nationalism* using mostly western traditions of academic theory and methodology as universally applicable. I find some irony too in basing my Japanese resume on my English manuscript, neither of which are my native languages.
[^41]: These concepts have been translated as *War of Position* and *War of Maneuver* [ @buttigieg_gramsci_1995;@gramsci_selections_1985: p.46]. It must be noted that this part of Gramsci's reasoning has since gained renewed popularity and seen appropriation by both Identitarian movements and the Alt-Right. Social institutions education and the mass media are seen as platforms for manufacturing consent to a hegemonic left-wing or globalist ideology, and the notion of Gramsci's counter-hegemony is re-framed as *metapolitics* [@stein_jeff_2018]. Belgian populist right-wing party member Dries Van Langenhove claims his Identitarian youth movement Schild & Vrienden to function as a vehicle of metapolitics [@nws_van_2018], and previous Vlaams Belang leader Filip de Winter added that "The methodology Gramsci promoted is the right one" ("De methodiek die Gramsci aanprees, is de juiste") [@ceulaer_6_2016].
[^42]: In this paper's introduction, I've noted the Alt-Right's infatuation with Japan in particular. Asking why, one might look at war-time relations between the far-right in the West and Japan. In Fukushima's mount Iimori, for example, I examined both an archaeological column of Pompeii, donated by Italian fascist leader Mussolini, and a 1930's German donation in the form of a black granite plate with an Iron Cross–as form of praise for the *bushido*-related war-time propagandistic media-event of the White Tiger Company military unit (*Byakkotai*, 白虎隊), the story of 19 teenagers that committed ritual suicide after mistakenly believing their castle to be fallen during the Bosshin War. Perhaps in more recent memory, one other answer could be found in a dialectic processes of cultural hegemony between Japan and the West. With the widespread 80's narratives of Japan as economical powerhouse and the growing cultural *soft* power of Cool Japan, many a page were written on the *Japanese model* (I think for example of Chalmers 1982 *MITI and the Japanese Miracle*), and thus a window opened to sell Japan's hegemonic ideology of *nihonjin* 日本人論 style of (ethno-)nationalism to the West.

[^44]: Far below Belgium (9), the United Kingdom (33) South Korea (41) and the United States (48). This ranking is based on among others restrictions of journalism in official press rooms (see concept of the "reporters club", the 記者クラブ *kisha kurabu*), strict policies against whistle blowers, and an increasingly hostile public climate towards public media [@noauthor_japan_2019].




[^45]: In its tonal shifts, structural composition and fractured nature, I feel like there is something inexplicit and unintentionally post-modern about this thesis as well. Postmodern-influenced academic literature could be a fun topic for future research.



[^46]: In which it came to light that illicitly obtained personal data of up to 87 million *Facebook* users were used for political advertising and data-analysis in favor of Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign and the British Leave.EU campaign.

[^54]: In *The Japanese Economy* however, @flath_japanese_2005 refers to the zaibatsu as "at best a kind of *petite bourgeoisie* [-@flath_japanese_2005, p.75]. @miwa_fable_2010 in polemic fashion dismisses the *Keiretsu* and *Zaibatsu* (industrial and financial business conglomerates) in its entirety as fictional scapegoats of "Marxist scholars in post-war Japan" and "populists journalists" [@miwa_fable_2010, p52]. He further argues a historical growing demand for literature on Japanese economics and a lack of Japanese-literate Western economics who have resorted to accounts by academics from other disciplines, perpetuating conventional Japan-centric claims on *main bank systems* and *industrial policy* [@miwa_fable_2010, pp.54-57].



[^56]: On 26/07/2019 A *New York Times* article on this reddit sub-community, The_Donald, reports that after repeated incitement to violence, aimed increasingly at police officers and public officials, the forum has now been "quarantined". This means that its content is no longer algorithmically featured on the front-page of the platform, that users have to log-in and specifically agree to enter the sub-community, and that no revenue will be generated through ads [@chokshi_reddit_2019]. Both Donald Trump's campaign manager and social media manager visit The_Donald on a daily basis  visits this community everyday [@parscale_reddit_2016;@restuccia_get_2019] and Donald Trump himself reportedly gave a Q&A in the community [@robertson_donald_2016].

[^57]: Particularly on 4chan and 2channel are ambiguity and cynicism inherent elements of discourse, increasing the difficulty of a critical reading. A blatantly offense message could be masked as irony either as defense for actual offensive intent, or as a deadpan form of inter-textual parody. This phenomenon is often referred to as Poe's Law.
[^58]: With social media, I refer to all online platforms used for computer-mediated communication and in which can be built.
[^59]: The English-language article portrays Netto-Uyoku as "Japanese neo-nationalists who interact almost entirely within their own cyber community, shut off from the rest of Japanese society" and who "first appeared on the Internet during the Lost Decade, which was an economic crisis in Japan from the 1990s to 2010s". This perpetuating the idea of Netto-Uyoku as a disenfranchised by-product of the Lost Decade. The page was created on 2016-06-01 with the most recent revision made on 2019-07-17. On 2018-11-11, A user by the name of "Normal Japanese" replaced the page contents with "anti-Japanese left wings will perish", which was reverted one minute afterwards.
[^23]: Another interesting expression considering this very word is rooted in capitalist commodity fetishism.

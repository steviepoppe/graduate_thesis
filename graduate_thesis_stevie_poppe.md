#Introduction

On August. 28, 2010 The New York times published an article titled "New Dissent in Japan Is Loudly Anti-Foreign", referring to a rise in politically motivated protest marches associated with a supposed Japanese "Net-Right". In it, Martin Fackler describes this "Net-Right" (hereinafter referred to by its Japanese term *Netto-Uyoku* ネット右翼)[^2] as "a new type of ultranationalist group ... a virtual community". He goes on to state that "while these groups remain a small if noisy fringe element here, they have won growing attention as an alarming side effect of Japan’s long economic and political decline" [@fackler_new_2010-1].[^1] A small fringe element that is nevertheless noisy enough to reach print press in the United States, in its most commonly applied form the term Netto-Uyoku applies to a loosely connected group of Internet users disseminating a form of extreme right-wing discourse online and active primarily on social media platforms such as Twitter, the anonymous messaging board 2channel,[^12] and streaming services such as Youtube and Niconico Douga.

Far from benign expressions of free speech limited to shadowy corners of the Internet, consequences of such outings have however crossed digital borders and materialized in disquieting, at times even violent ways. As Fackler earlier hinted at in his New York Times piece, the Netto-Uyoku are accredited with the rise of the neo-nationalist[^9] Action Conservative Movement (ACM), which includes such groups as Zaitokukai[^8] and Shukenkai[^7] [@higuchi_japans_2016;@gill_nativist_2018]. Furthermore, according to a 2016 investigation by the Japanese department of Justice, a total of 1152 protest marches, xenophobic in nature and associated with the ACM, were found to be held across Japan between the period April 2012 and September 2015 [@nikaido__2016]. Makoto Sakurai, Zaitokukai-founder and a key figure in both the ACM and Netto-Uyoku movement, has been arrested for violence associated with such protest marches, and after stepping down as its leader went on to form the populist right-wing Japan First Party (both which will be extensively covered by this paper in further chapters). 

Nearly a decade after Fackler's publication in the New York Times, coverage of the Netto-Uyoku and related topics such as the ACM and Zaitokukai remains relatively scarce.[^4] Moreover, whenever the topic does reach mainstream outlets, there appears to be a tendency of framing the Netto-Uyoku as little more than a fringe movement and side-effect of economical malaise with little real-life influence.[^5] Nevertheless, as shown above, actions associated with this movement have had real-life consequences, not the least including the 2016 adoption of an anti-discrimination law in order to curb hate speech. Additionally, a 2017 paper on political bots in Japan even went as far as to suggest a hidden nationalist agenda of Prime Minister Abe Shinzo tied to that of the Netto-Uyoku, and viewing them as a potential "enormous online support army of Abe’s agenda" [@schafer_japans_2017], something that the author of this paper too has previously alluded to.[^14]

It goes without saying that expressions of neo-nationalist sentiment taking place largely within the confines of social media and shaped by a distinct Internet discourse are by no means limited to Japanese territory. The outcome of the United States' 2016 presidential elections, the 2016 British Brexit-referendum and the rise of neo-nationalist, that is to say, right-wing populist ideology amongst various European political campaigns can be seen as trends of greater global political struggles. When more closely examined it will then too come to no big surprise, considering the extent it has penetrated our daily lives, that the role of the Internet and social media was of no small importance in those outcomes. Backing the cult of personality of respective presidents Vladimir Putin, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Xi Jinping, as well as the in 2016 elected president of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte, are supposed "online troll armies". Deliberately and both on a voluntary or paid basis spreading disinformation and attacking self-perceived enemies of their respective presidents, these online troll armies have on multiple instances been accredited with manipulation of political discourse online in order to influence elections, including in more recent memory the 2016 presidential elections in the United States.[^3] 

Moreover, the Alt-Right (arguably the western counterparts to the Netto-Uyoku and associated primarily with the United States) have drawn much ire after a white nationalist terror attack in Charlottesville, Virginia during its Unite the Right rally, and again after little disavowal by the President of the United States.[^24] In similar fashion, the Identitarian Movement is associated foremost with (Western) Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and it should be noted that the perpetrator of the March 2019 terror attack in New Zealand sprinkled his manifesto with deeply ironic Internet subculture rhetoric associated with those movements.[^13] In Belgium, the mid-2019 elected politician Dries van Langenhove (aligned with populist right-wing party Vlaams Belang), acquired online attention through his mimicry of rhetoric used by online-based far-right nationalist movements such as the Alt-Right,[^25] as revealed in a 2018 documentary of notorious youth movement Schild & Vrienden.[^10] In France, the term *fachosphère* came to denote similar trends on the French Internet after Le Monde published a series of articles linking Marine Le Pen's populist far-right Front National, Online video-game community jeuxvideo.com and Internet trolls [@laurent_nordactu_2016;@audureau_les_2017].[^16] In South Korea, the populist far-right Liberty Korea Party (LKP) has been condemned for its usage of "online Internet trolls", its former chairman, presidential candidate and Youtuber Hong Joon-Pyo has often been compared to Donald Trump [**he-rim source**], and the online platform Ilbe Storage is described as hosting the South Korean equivalent of the Japanese Netto-uyoku and promoting an neo-conservative agenda as well [@shim_hardcore_2015]. 

In light of the above information, it is clear that the Internet as a medium plays an undeniable role, not just in the organization of neo-nationalist movements, but in shaping its discourse as well. Furthermore, Japan's international soft power has without a doubt left its mark on many online communities abroad as well, seeping particular into the Alt-Right and Identitarian Movement. As one article states, it is increasingly common to see images of Japanese animation characters sporting political symbols ranging from neo-Nazi imagery to Trump-related iconography such as MAGA hats [@charity_why_2016]. The English-language anonymous messaging board 4chan,[^17] currently owned by 2channel founder Hiroyuki Nishimura, was intended to be a North-American copy of its Japanese equivalent 2channel with a focus on discussing Japanese pop-culture, but came under heavy scrutiny in 2014 for its association with the Gamergate controversy[^18] and the Alt-Right. 

The political discussion board /pol/ ("Politically Incorrect") in particular contains strong neo-nationalist rhetoric exemplary of the Alt-Right. Three seminal studies found the communities formed around political boards like 4chan's "*/pol/*" and  Reddit's "*r/The_Donald*" to be an important hub for influencing mainstream political discourse and setting "the narrative agenda for mainstream media outlets" [@hine_kek_2016; @pearson_scientists_2016; @zannettou_web_2017; @zannettou_origins_2018]. Alt-right appropriated *viral* imagery ("*memes*")[^19] such as that of a green anthropomorphic frog ("Pepe the Frog") too find their roots in those communities, and have been shared by members of the White House, including Donald Trump and Donald Trump Jr. [@lee_understanding_2016; @ohlheiser_analysis_2016; @phillips_alt-right_2016]. Furthermore, former Donald Trump strategist and Breitbart News Network owner Steve Bannon praised Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as being "Trump before Trump", while other Alt-Right and Identitarian Movement associates have praised Japan as an exemplary ethno-state.[^20] Journalist Audrea Lim, in her The New York times editorial, even goes so far to claim "yellow favor" (a sexual obsession with those of Asian descent) as a common trait amongst the Alt-Right, stating that many public figures in the movement have had documented relationships with Asian women [-@lim_opinion_2018].

Thus, to reiterate, an increase of mainstream news reports claim online communities with an origin in discussing Japanese pop-culture to 1. be hotbeds for right-wing radicalization, and 2. important electoral spaces for both right-wing populist political parties and for politically motivated citizen movements in the United States and Europe. Members of those movements have praised Japan as the ideal of an "ethnostate", and have themselves gained political traction outside the realm of the digital. While it goes beyond this paper's scope to hypothesize on reasons for the Alt-Right's arguable infatuation with Japan, it would, based on the context painted in this paper's introduction, at least like to suggest a necessity of researching such instances of online neo-nationalism. 

Existing literature has thus far viewed the Netto-Uyoku in a greater debate of (trans)national identity, discrimination and of questions to what qualifies as freedom of speech [@tsuji__2008;@yasuda_:_2013;@morris-suzuki_beyond_2015]. Yet this author feels there is sufficient place available to discuss and hypothesize on the socio-cultural background of the Netto-Uyoku, as well as on its ideology, demography and *modus operandi*. This paper intents to read the Netto-Uyoku not as a noisy fringe element of Japanese society, but as a movement with political agency, with an ability to mobilize both on and off-line, and the power to exert influence on public discourse. Furthermore, while media-utilization is a strong trait of democratic elections worldwide, this paper argues that a shift of what could be considered top-down, mediated media (such as newspapers, radio and television) to so-called unmediated, bottom-up new media on the Internet brings new strategies and challenges to the political play-field. That, even in a country that since its post-war history has on a national scale, for all its intricacies, been mostly monopolized by a single party, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).

Within the context of Internet and politics, academics and journalists alike have to various degrees debated and hypothesized on the contribution of the Internet to political polarization, on the Internet's utilization by political actors applying populist strategies, and on the media effects of the so-called 'new media' on its users regarding political awareness and opinion-forming (such as the effects of so-called echo chambers).[^15] Although deliberate misinformation ("fake news") is by no means a new trend either,[^11] this too has thrived due the Internet's widespread usage. The lack of moderation and the spontaneity of social network platforms facilitates the (conscious) spreading and sharing of false information (or information seen loose of its context), without reflection or without source control, and has potentially far-reaching political consequences. While this paper refrains from taking a hard technological determinist position towards the Internet (the implication being that the existence of the Internet as new medium would by itself be a lead cause for societal change),[^22] and treats the Netto-uyoku in part as a symptom of deeper cultural malaise, it does suggest that by no means should the Internet be dismissed as merely a tool of communication that is itself shaped by societal changes; two takes that both have often been reported in respects to the Netto-Uyoku and other online-based neo-nationalist movements (**sources here**). There is a great amount of scholarship on the topic of media, ideology and politics and the debate on the extent to which media itself shapes (political) ideology will prove to be crucial in deepening our understanding of the Netto-Uyoku. 

The first chapter of this paper serves to lay a common theoretical groundwork on concepts as neo-nationalism, populism, and media, and conciliate particular models with corresponding research by Japanese peers. The author follows @taggart_populism_2000, @laclau_populist_2005 and @mudde_oxford_2013 in their definitions of populism as a model antagonizing a homogeneous elite in contrast to "the People's Will", a homogeneous group of "ordinary people", utilizing a "us versus them" dichotomy. It then further analyzes compatibility with a so-called "Japanese model of populism" (*nihongata popyurizumu* 日本型ポピュリズム) as described by Japanese scholars such as @otake__2003, @kimura__2006, Matsutani Mitsuru [-@matsutani__2009; -@matsutani_nihon-gata_2010], @yoshida__2011, and @kobori_populism_2013. This is important for defining our view of neo-nationalism as distinct from nationalist ideology through its application of the above-defined thin-centered populism, which the author will attempt to apply to such instances of right-wing movements on the Internet as the Alt-Right and the Netto-Uyoku.

In an attempt to a critical reading of the Internet and politics, this chapter will then draw on the works of media studies-pioneers Marshall McLuhan, Harrold Inis and Friedrich Kittler. Although rooted in technological determinism, McLuhan argued similarly to @azuma_ippan_2011, @tamura_niggling_2014 that the very nature of electronic media would shrink the world into a 'global village' and cause social change through increased social and political involvement and awareness. Precisely because of the general lack of gate-keepers and the dual role of the Internet-user as both consumer and producer does the the Internet as medium thus serve as perfect representation McLuhan's notion of 'global village'.[^21] This chapter will also draw from the works of @appadurai_modernity_1996, @anderson_imagined_2006 and social critics as Kitada Akihiro [-@kitada__2008;-@kitada_owaranai_2018] and @murai_net_2012.

Based on the framework put in place in the first chapter, the second chapter will first give a brief overview on the development of the Internet, both on a global scale and on its implementation in Japan. Second, in order to understand the distinct Netto-Uyoku discourse, it will in detail analyze the development digital communities and online discourse on the Japanese Internet. While the Internet's transnational means of communication are of critical importance to \nth{21} century globalism, the Internet does not exist in a void and even its very creation is political in nature. When seen as a cultural artifact, the cultural background of regions as mainland China and Japan infer a different logistical implementation of the Internet when compared to the United States, giving rise to different expression of the Internet in daily life. For this part, the author will draw heavily from Japanese cultural critics as @azuma__2007; @azuma_ippan_2011 and @kitada__2008; @kitada_owaranai_2018, @kurahashi_:_2018, @matsuda_uwasa_2014 @__2017-1.

The third chapter offers a closer look on the Netto-Uyoku and suggest a new definition of Netto-Uyoku as a loosely connected group of neo-nationalists formed in post-bubble cynicism resentment, using primarily the Internet and discourses formed on Japanese social media to disseminate ideology. 

Concretely, it attempts to answer such questions as:

- What is the demography of the Netto-Uyoku movement?
- How should we define Netto-Uyoku ideology, if at all present in Netto-Uyoku rhetoric?
- how do Netto-Uyoku ideologically compare to the ultra-nationalist Uyoku Dantai?
- What processes do Netto-Uyoku employ to disseminate ideology?
- How do Netto-uyoku compare to other online-based neo-nationalist movements? Can we speak of a distinct Japanese character compared to contemporary movements, or should we view Netto-Uyoku primarily as part of a greater trend of Internet-fueled populist neo-nationalism? Secondly, is there a common reaction to, for example, the Alt-Right and Trump-era politics?
- How does the movement organize and mobilize, both online and in real life?
- Is there possible space for furthering a Netto-Uyoku political "agenda" through influencing its international counterparts?

To achieve this, this chapter will first conduct a discourse analysis, contrasting discourse on communities associated with Netto-Uyoku (such as 2channel and niconico) with more mainstream platforms such as Youtube an Twitter, where we draw the bulk of our dataset. For this purpose, this paper will heavily utilize methods from the Digital Humanities and Socio-Informatic domains. Using a sentiment and frequency analysis on those platforms concerning topics closely tied to common Netto-Uyoku rhetoric (such as that targeting ethnic Koreans and Chinese, mainstream media, and the Japanese Prime Minister) might, for example, reveal certain levels of seepage and normalization of far-right thought in the mainstream discourse. Next, this chapter will take a look at the networks surrounding the ACM and the call for mobilization online. The discourse analysis will use quantitative and qualitative methods using social networking platforms or forums as Twitter and 2channel to provide the bulk of its data. Additionally, a frequency analysis of both twitter data as newspapers might also prove a growing trend of right-wing terminology originated on the internet reaching mainstream discourse. 

This chapter will draw on previous research concerning the Netto-Uyoku, such as that by @yasuda_netto_2012, @yasuda_:_2013, @yasuda_:_2019, @tsuji__2008, @schafer_japans_2017 and @ota_saraba_2019.

Finally, it should be mentioned that any research involving the Internet and social networks online is bound to have some limitations. In this case limitations involve liquidity of data, copyright laws pertaining acquiring data and lack of reliability due anonymity blocking full intent of the author.

#Chapter 1: Media, Populism and Japan

##Ideology

##Approaches to Populism

(thin-centered model definition by mudde, taggart, Laclau)

a homogenous 'People' (or 'heartland', as defined by Taggart), the antagonistic struggle with a homogeneous elitist 'Other', and finally the populist actor framing themselves as a defender of the 'People's Will'. Lacleau, building on Saussure and Levi-Strauss' socio-linguistic work, denotes these terms as 'empty signifiers': abstract symbols expressing universal ideas through different contexts until seen complete loose from any conceptual meaning. Whilst their theories describe populism as a "*thin-centered*" ideology, thus broadening the contextual scale of application, this chapter will first analyze compatibility with a so-called "Japanese model of populism" (*nihongata popyurizumu* 日本型ポピュリズム) as described by Japanese scholars such as @otake__2003, @kimura__2006, Matsutani Mitsuru [-@matsutani__2009; -@matsutani_nihon-gata_2010], @yoshida__2011, and @kobori_populism_2013. Their respective research typically begin with Koizumi Jun'ichiro's television play and utilization of so-called 'wide-shows' and his utilization of television as a starting point. Although this paper's scope is limited to 'new media' and expressions of a Japanese populism, we can recognize a more recent "new wave of populism" during the early '00s, a period in time during which political reforms saw a rise of populist actors as Ishihara Shintaro and Hashimoto Toru, as well as in more recent memory Koike Yuriko's successful election as Tokyo Governor in 2016 and the Netto-Uyoku backed Party for Japanese Kokoro (*Nippon no Kokoro* 日本のこころ). 

####Three Pointers: The People, the Elite, the Will

While the normative signifier of 'the People' or 'heartland' refers to the ideal of one people or one nation, thus generalizing a group to one homogeneous whole without taking into account pluralist differences in this group, in populist ideology the 'Other' usually denotes a moral antagonist in the form of a social or economic 'elite' (usually referred to as 'the establishment'), utilizing its socio-economic 'power' to oppress these 'People'. For politicians already considered part of 'the establishment', this element of socio-economic 'power' could turn out a beneficial way to, through populist measures, blame one's lack of political success on (for example by antagonizing their banking world, or mainstream media and its press-members). Aside from the Other as an Elite, the 'new wave of right-wing populism' spreading across the world has strong tendencies of antagonizing the Other on basis of ethnic heritage: ranging from xenophobic rhetoric aimed at Muslim communities through West-Europe and the United States, to that aimed at Korean diaspora present in Japan. Finally, the 'People's Will', based on Rousseau's 'General Will' concept of direct democracy (rather than representative democracy) with a nation's people directly responsible for political decision making, takes a nativist turn as a populist trait, tilting towards authoritarianism by assuming a group's homogeneousness (Abts en Rummens 2007, 408–9). It remains important however to keep in mind that these trends of populism should not just be judged as purely anti-democratic, but just as well as a democratic corrective measure indicates groups in society who feel insufficiently represented.

####Supply and Demand: Media as supply-side factor

####Japanese model of populism (*Nihon-gata Popyurizumu* 日本型ポピュリズム)

(Otake Hideo, Kimura Masato, Matsutani Mitsuru, Yoshida Tori, Kobori Masahiro)

##What is Neo-Nationalism?

##Media

###Internet, a new 'global' village?

##Politicized digital spaces: Internet as harborer of democracy?

Despite some cultural lag, there are now many theoretical options to approaching the Internet, new media, and politics. In an early stage, Rimmer and Morris-Suzuki (1999), following sociologists Kumon Shumpei and Masuda Yoneji's writings on a 'teledemocracy', take an utopian view and predicted the Internet would serve democracy by fundamentally altering its users thinking patterns and leading to a power-shift away from mass-media. Recent debate on the Internet's role in populist politics in East-Asia (Youngmi Kim 2009, Azuma Hiroki 2011, Tamura en Kobayashi 2014) have instead taken a distinct dystopian turn, employing such terms as 'the People's Will 2.0', and again arguing that due the very nature of computer-mediated communication and social media, with traits such as anonymity, filter-bubbles and so-called 'echo-chambers', the individual 'will' has been reduced to a general 'will' led by emotion rather than rationality. Thus, following this logic, Internet as an open medium for communication would become an invaluable tool for political leaders utilizing a populist narrative.

But what comfort from memories of the twentieth century?!?"

##Media Theory

USE MATSUDA HERE FOR SOURCES ON MEDIA USAGE IN JAPAN




While the Toronto School of communication theory has some detractors due its reliance on dichotomies, its members Harrold Innis (of "The Bias of Communication") and Mcluhan argue that the invention of print-media led to both a horizontal (regional) and vertical (chronological) continuity and structures redefining our cognitive senses, bringing about a literate 'space-biased' culture rather than an oral 'time-biased' one, and thus a heightened sense of individualism, capitalism and nationalism.[^23] With his idea of a 'global village', McLuhan however hypothesized that a shift towards electronic media, referring at the time primarily to radio and television, would again shift society. This time from a literate culture to a 'post-literate' visual culture that stimulates all senses and transcends time and space, thus leading individualism to a collective, homogeneous identity, in which the lack of a physical body or physical cues creates a different relation to oneself and one's surroundings. (McLuhan, 1962, p. 156, McLuhan 1967:63). Amongst other important early scholars within Media Studies stands Friedrich Kittler, generally associated with the German media theory school. Unlike McLuhan, who argues media as an extension of human senses, Kittler approaches media through his New Materialism theory and his concept of 'discourse networks', applying Foucoult's concept of power and archeology of knowledge in function of media, to allows media its own agency.

These ideas also fits well political scientist Benedict Anderson's notion of Imagined Communities, coined during his research on nationalism and the rise of nation-states. Anderson suggests that nations are not communities in a strict sense, but 'imagined' communities at best, implying that the sense of kinship felt between its members is but a social construct based on mutual experiences evolved from print capitalism and the rise of mass-media, and thus develop both a sense of imagined sameness, as well as clearly defined paradigm of 'otherness'. In a similar sense, social media on the Internet creates a perceived sense of affinity between its members and the social and interpersonal change of this 'global village', or 'imagined cyber-community' can be argued to transcends that of it's nation. In similar fashion, anthropologist @appadurai_modernity_1996 too already argued early on that the rise of the Internet as a new 'mediascape' would lead to the creation of new, transnational and asynchronous imagined communities, based on ideology rather than on national narratives, and diverting from traditional mass-media. Murai Shusuke (-@murai_net_2012, 375–76) argues however the opposite; precisely due Japanese Internet-users' monolingualism, not withstanding full global access through the Internet, any possibility of trans-nationality is severely limited. Within the anonymity of on-line bulletin boards such as 2channel, social markers remain thus primarily defined by language and nation-based ideology. (Naoki Sakai here?) @sakai_translation_1997


    Ideologies are present in politics in many ways. More concretely, I shall look for three specific ideological traits in this thesis. First, political actors construct and act upon images of friends and enemies – normative images of themselves as the right electoral choice in comparison to their enemies, which may be concrete (political competitors) or more abstract phenomena (e.g. capitalism, globalization). Certainly, such images need also explanations of why the cause of the protagonist is more important than other causes.


Edward Said:

The alternative to an exclusionary representational system for Said would be one that is “participatory and collaborative, non-coercive, rather than imposed”, yet he recognised the extreme difficulty involved in bringing about such an alternative.[14] Difficult because advances in the “electronic transfer of images” is increasing media concentration in the hands of powerful, transnational conglomerates.[

Furthermore, within the field of social psychology Eun-Ju Lee applies a social identity approach (focusing on deindividuation and group polarization on the internet) and argues that the lack of social signals

#Chapter 3: Netto-Uyoku - Expressions of Nationalism in the Age of the Internet

##History

To demonstrate the reach the Netto-Uyoku have had, this paper's introduction briefly touched upon an English-language print article in The New York Times. It goes without saying the term has been in use since a much earlier date. The first English-language mention in mainstream media can be traced back to March. 14, 2006, when Journalist Eric Johnston wrote a piece for The Japan Times on right-wing nationalism and the Internet in Japan, "Net boards venue for faceless rightists". In his piece, Johnston associates these "faceless rightists" (further referred to as "Net Uyoku") with the anonymous Internet forum 2Channel, online video platform Channel Sakura and the conservative political organization Nippon Kaigi [@johnston_net_2006]. In Japan, the term first reached print press in a 2005 Mainichi Shimbun article by @sasaki__2005, a journalist with a lengthy publishing record on Japanese Internet discourse.

This paper would like to suggest a new definition of netto-uyo as a loosely connected group of neo-nationalists expressing post-bubble ressentiment using primarily the Internet and discourses formed on Japanese social media to disseminate ideology. This paper further suggests that 

If this paper were to take a technological determinist view, it would suggest that the medium of Internet itself is a main catalyst for forming the backbone of a supposed netto-uyo ideology. Its antithesis would take place in social determinism: 
What's left is but to suggest

radicalizing effect: through the rabbit hole with memes
forming communities around loneliness (see zaitokukai book)

ressentiment as driver for populist politics

“slave morality”, marked by nationalism, xenophobia and fragmentation -> Nietzsche

This paper attempts an explanation of netto-uyo relying strongly on critical theory.

As pointed out later in this chapter, there is a clear contrast in ideology between what could be referred to as the Old Right and what we refer to as the Net Right; due the loose nature of the netto-uyoku as a community, it is rightfully difficult to speak of any ideology at all. I would like to suggest a typology

The ニュース速報（嫌儲）community left for Reddit when 2ch changed their API to force all users to browse the site using an adware-ridden custom browser, which also collected personal information of users. However, I think many of them got bored with Reddit and went back to their own Kenmou-affiliated sites (besides the main board on 2ch, I think there are also Livedoor and mixi communities).

But the split between the Kenmou community and the rest of 2ch goes back much further. About 10 years ago, matome (affiliate) bloggers began collating threads from News4VIP or ニュース速報（VIP）(similar to /b/, it was originally a place for spam and overall terrible threads but metamorphosed into a generalized chit-chat board about random topics). Average Japanese internet users could find out about net gossip without having to steep themselves in 2ch's unique culture (in 4chan terms: "lurk before you post").

Because of the kind of users that News4VIPs attracted by virtue of its origins, the anonymity and captive audience inherent in large bulletin boards (GIFT, Japan-style) that allowed users to be 100% honne and abandon tatemae, as well as the culturally-ingrained racism against Chinese and Korean people in Japan, these matome blogs featured a lot of anti-Korean, anti-Zainichi vitriol spewed by VIPpers.

As these blogs became popular, they became a vehicle for netuyo to advance far right wing causes on the Japanese internet. Furthermore, as their popularity increased, view-count ad money started becoming important, and to get more eyeballs on their posts, matome bloggers engaged in yellow journalism: they sensationalized 2ch posts, posted fake news, and practiced stealth marketing. So now there was a situation where matome bloggers were spreading netuyo crap for profit.

This incensed the countable-on-one-hand number of left wingers on 2ch to such an extent that the staff gave them their own breaking news board, ニュース速報（嫌儲）, separate from VIPpers. This is where the term kenmou (嫌儲) comes from; it refers opposed to people opposed to the matome. 嫌 means "unpleasant" or "offensive" and 儲 is an uncommon Sino-Japanese character* that means "a store [or reserve] of saved money". In this case, it refers to the ad money accrued by matome bloggers using unscrupulous strategies such as yellow journalism. Why the character 儲 was used, and from where the reading of もう came, I have no idea.

I've heard whispers that the kenmou community also disliked how the right wing ステマ from the matome blogs was spreading to the anime industry. Though I'm not 100% sure.

https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%AB%8C%E5%84%B2

As an aside, 2ch is related to Dwango, which runs a popular video sharing site, and is very, very friendly with the center-right LDP; a nephew of former PM Taro Aso is on its board of directors (and that of Kadokawa, a prolific licensor of novels and manga). Ever wonder why the '政治' category on the latter website is the Japanese equivalent of Breitbart? Now you know.

##Netouyo


Both in Japan and in the west, journalists have to different extents referred to the Internet and media as an important contributor to the rise of ultra-nationalism and right-wing populism experienced over the world. At a first glance, scholarship too seems divided on the extent of social media's impact in the cultural phenomenon of netouyo and internet-based nationalism. What are the theoretical approaches taken on the netouyo, the alt-right (without applying a dichotomy between the two; this paper will frame these as two expressions of a greater global phenomenon) and in general expressions of nationalism through social media.

##Internet:

There is a great amount of scholarship on the topic of media, ideology and politics. Debates go beyond just social media, and to a greater extent the internet as a whole, as merely a platform for dispersing views difficult to expression on more closed forms of media. On a socio-cultural level, scholarship continues to debate the extent to which media itself shapes our ideology. Understanding this debate is crucial to deepening our understanding of the netouyo.

It is important to touch upon the development of the Internet both on a global scale and on its implementation in Japan. While the Internet's transnational means of communication are key in 21th century globalism, the Internet does not exist in a void: the cultural background of say, mainland China in comparison to the United States means a different logistical implementation of the Internet, and thus have given rise to different expression of the Internet in daily life.

 ""We are past being a literate culture and are now a visual culture," said "
 "Through the power of Trump, a bunch of people with anime avatars have attained far more influence."

 California-based psychologist Sandy Peace, who emphasizes the value of connectedness in her practice, attributes much of this anger to alienation and anomie. "The roots of trolling behavior, particularly among young men, are complicated, but I lay much of the blame on the internet and how it stymies interaction with real people and prevents the development of real feelings," she said. "The less connected you are, the less you have to lose, which makes it far easier to say shocking or hurtful things. Just like Trump: he doesn't care about whose feelings he hurts so long as he makes his point."


 To assert that alt-right shitposters were a deciding factor in Trump's victory risks minimizing the broader cultural, societal, and media trends that influenced their influence


 Alt-Right: From 4chan to the White House

Molly Sauter, another researcher at the Berkman Klein Center and author of The Coming Swarm, a book about hacker culture and hacktivism, correctly noted that to really get a meme, you have to be versed in layers upon layers of irony and in-group thinking, and therefore even memes that seem inoffensive to casual meme tourists might be problematic.



P371 Susan J Pharr Media and Politics in Japan

ARGUMENT dat media door informal decision making niet plural wordt, tov internet

As Pharr points out, however, when academic research on politics
has not ignored the media completely, it has tended to minimize the
media’s power to affect the polities in which we live. As several of the
authors in this volume indicate, the “minimal effects” model of
media such as television has been particularly dominant in the study
of American politics; little evidence has been offered of the media’s
ability to change citizens’ basic political attitudes and beliefs, and

This could be seen through the actions of right-wing populist Zaitokukai founder Makoto Sakurai mobilizing followers for real-live demonstrations against the presence of Zainichi Koreans, but also through those of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe broadcasting his December 2012 speech in front of Akihabara (already a very deliberate choice of location) on popular video platform Niconico.

It will instead utilize the term neo-nationalism to sufficiently distinct the ACM from the ultranationalist Japanese militants collectively known as *uyoku dantai* (右翼団体, "right wing groups"). While often used in the context of mid 2010's European and North-American movements, the term neo-nationalism refers to a type of nationalism marked by right-wing populism, cultural racism, anti-globalisation and nativism, and arguably most closely describes the ACM ideologically [@dougherty_new_2016; @hirsh_why_2016]. This will be covered to greater detail in chapter one and three.

[^13]: During the terror attack, the perpetrator referenced an online trend concerning Swedish Youtube influencer Felix Khellberg (known by his online handler PewDiePie and as of writing subscribed to by over 95 million followers). Khellberg came under increasing scrutiny for racial remarks and has been referred to as part of a gateway to the reactionary right [@lewis_alternative_2018; @dickson_why_2019; @roose_mass_2019]. In the perpetrator's manifesto, the perpetrator describes himself as "just an ordinary White man, 28 years old" and references a white supremacy conspiracy theory popularized by Alt-Right Youtube influencer Lauren Southern. This theory, known as "The Great Replacement", is featured on the Identitarian Movement's homepage and has been adopted by populist right-wing figures such as Dutch politician Geert Wilters, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. It has arguably been endorsed by President of the United States Donald Trump, who has shared tweets with the hashtag "#whitegenocide" [@weiss_opinion_2018; @manjoo_opinion_2019].
[^14]: This paper expands upon the author's undergraduate thesis [@poppe_digitaal_2017], written under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Dimitri Vanoverbeke. In his undergraduate thesis, the author examined the Netto-Uyoku as potential electorate of populist politicians on both a national and regional scale.

[^17]:  Since its launch in 2003 4chan has been commonly accredited with popularizing many aspects now common to Internet communities. The message-board has several sections devoted to Japanese pop-culture, and in 2019 claimed over 27,700,000 unique visitors per month.Of note is the self-assessed demography of its users, consisting of a a mostly millennial, male user-base from the United States and Western Europe, listing interests as "Japanese culture, anime, manga, video games, comics, technology, music, movies" [@noauthor_advertise_nodate; @ellis_4chan_2018].
[^18]: A co-ordinated and reactionary harassment campaign against women targeting sexism in video game culture and the multi-billion video game industry, the Gamergate Controversy can be interpreted as a culture war against diversification of a supposed gamer identity (a cultural identity that has traditionally been associated with men). The controversy has had widespread coverage, including condemnation by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and was extensively covered by Alt-Right key-figure Milo Yiannopoulos on the far-right website Breitbart News Network. The outcome of this campaign has been said to have had radicalizing effects amongst its supporters [@wofford_is_2014; @johnston_chat_2014; @martens_rally_2017].
[^20]: Other such Alt-Right associates include Jared Taylor (who is fluent in Japanese) and Richard Spencer (who coined the term "Alt-Right"). It should be noted that a short news-report on Youtube covering this topic, "A Lot Of White Supremacists Seem To Have An Asian Fetish (HBO)" by @vice_news_lot_2017, had as of writing, a ratio of 6,1K dislikes to 5,6K likes. The author identified a newly posted comment by "Notification Email" (barring a play-list of game-related videos an otherwise empty account) to state "absolute state of (((modern journalism))) ... the truth is people longing culture about sincerity, chivalry, family value, etc. the west is beyond saved from the sinner, hedonist, liar, and degenerate." Another comment, by the account "ShadyxFiascoX 32", had 166 likes and stated "Personally Hitler loved Japan and said they had a good culture. What the hell is (((Vice))) talking about". In both cases the triple parentheses (originated from Alt-Right discourse) implies Jewish ownership of the video's owner, Vice News. One comment, by "Ochiai's Channel" misinterprets this video's content by posting "I am Japanese, and can I consider his talk as a hate speech against us?!". His channel, with a follower count of 610 subscribers and viewed over 87K times as of writing, states both in Japanese and English *2-Channeru-nado ni katte ni rinku o iron'na tokoro ni hattari,nan nara katte ni bideo o ichibu o kiritotte riyō suru no, OKdesu! ... Tada, han'nichi no hitotachi wa, do no yōna katachideare, riyō wa okotowarishimasu.* (「２ちゃんねる等に勝手にリンクを色んな所に貼ったり、なんなら勝手にビデオを一部を切り取って利用するの、OKです！ ... ただ、反日の人達は、どのような形であれ、利用はお断りします。」) and "You can paste my videos anywhere, or you can even download it and edit to use it. ... However, if you're anti-Japan or pro-migration, you're not welcome to do any of those in any means" [@noauthor_ochiais_nodate].
[^3]: In the case of state-sponsored Internet propaganda, @kovic_digital_2018 defined this practice as "digital astroturfing", calling it "a form of manufactured, deceptive and strategic top-down activity on the Internet initiated by political actors that mimics bottom-up activity by autonomous individuals".
[^21]: It is fitting too then that former Vice President of the United States, Al Gore, referred to the Internet in a 1994 speech for the International Telecommunication Union, as "information superhighways" that would serve as a "metaphor of democracy" and lead to a "gobal community". The text is available in full at <http://vlib.iue.it/history/internet/algorespeech.html>.
[^22]: "(1) Determinism is a philosophical system that posits every physical event, including human cognition and action, is causally determined by an unbroken chain of past occurrences and therefore makes it possible for us to know future effects with certainty. Technological determinism claims that technology is an autonomous, "self-controlling, self-determining, self-generating, self-propelling, self-propelling, selfperpetuating and self-expanding force ... out of human control, changing under its own momentum and 'blindly' shaping society" [@chandler_act_1995, p.1]

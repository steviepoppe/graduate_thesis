Terms as *alt-right*, *fachosphère* and *Netto-Uyoku* have in their respective languages entered the mainstream discourse and refer to a phenomenon of online-based right-wing populist nationalism. This paper intends to conceptualize this phenomenon as cyber-nationalism, adopting a mixed method (quantitative and computer-assisted) content analysis to media-platforms associated with the Japanese cyber-nationalists.
We find the Frankfurt School approach to ideological critique suitable to theoretically ground our research. A reading of right-wing populist rhetoric reveals a distinct flavor of Gramscian logic therein: established politics, left-wing institutions and mainstream media manufacture consent to the hegemonic ideology of the elite, which does not adequately represent the people’s will and defers from self-perceived contradictions in society. The Internet as imagined Habermasian public sphere is then ideal for disseminating counter-hegemonic ideologies. 
Yet despite the existence of ultra-nationalist grassroots movements as the Zaitokukai, and the term Netto-Uyoku itself implying a prevalent electorate for Japanese right-wing populists as Sakurai Makoto, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has retained its grip on politics. For this, we hypothesize that while populist newcomers have on a global scale capitalized on the distrust of established institutions experienced by these cyber-nationalists, the LDP has effectively done this earlier in the wake of the 2011 earthquake. We then find two elements contributing to the LDP's success amongst Japanese cyber-nationalists: 1.) the ideological hegemony spread by the LDP through the state-sponsored soft-power of its culture industry has not left Japanese cyber-nationalists untouched; and 2.) the LDP appeals to Japanese cyber-nationalists by manufacturing public outrage and exploiting the same self-perceived contradictions in society in society that have led to counter-hegemonic movements elsewhere. 

In conclusion, we argue that Netto-Uyoku should be understood as an embodiment of cyber-nationalism in Japan.

In my first chapter, I prove a distinct link between the utilization of the Internet and 21th century style right-wing populism. Terms as troll armies, alt-right, netto-uyoku, etc express a global phenomenon of groups of Internet users (cyber-nationalists) embracing and supporting right-wing populists and utilizing the internet for political campaigning.
In my second chapter, I try to pinpoint the ideological reasonings behind these supposed cyber-nationalists. I find a distinct flavor of gramscian and Frankfurt School style of ideological reasoning behind the cyber-nationalists' usage of the Internet as a means to dissiminate a counter-hegemonical ideology in which populist thought of antagonizing mass-media and left-wing thought while embracing ethnic nationalism thrive. Following McLuhan's reasoning on Media, we conclude that the Internet itself is not loose of ideology and has itself roots in libertarian, counter-culture ideology.
Yet, as I explain in my third chapter, despite the term Netto-Uyoku implying an electorate for anti-establishment right-wing populists, the LDP remains the politically dominant force. I argue two arguments behind this:
1. 2011
2. Media

Met de onverwachte uitslagen van de presidentiele verkiezingscampagne in de Verenigde Staten 

With the unexpected outcome of—amongst various political events—the presidential election campaign in the United States and the UK independence movement, the pivotal year of 2016 brought to light the extent right-wing populism has infiltrated global politics across democratic nations. Furthermore, with the increasingly dominant position of the Internet and social media in our daily lives, so too has computer mediated communication become a critical aspect of political campaigning, with the additional risk of polarization and radicalization on fringe sub-culture communities. Terms as 'troll armies', 'alt-right', 'fachosphère' and the Japanese 'Netto-Uyoku' have in their respective languages entered the mainstream discourse and refer to a particular phenomenon of right-wing populism occurring specifically on social media an the Internet. A phenomenon this paper attempts to conceptualize as cyber-nationalism. An ideological reading of right-wing populist rhetoric reveals a distinct flavor of Frankfurt School and Gramscian logic: established politics, left-wing educational institutions and mainstream media serve to manufacture consent to the hegemonic ideology of the 'elite', which does not adequately represent the 'people's will' and defers from self-perceived contradictions in society. In this sense, the Internet as imagined *Public Sphere* offers an ideal way for disseminating a counter-hegemonic ideology. Following McLuhan's notion of the medium as the message, neither are the Internet and the World Wide Web (the later rooted in libertarian counter-culture movements and described as an 'electronic frontier') free of ideology. Although early futurists as ... suggested the Internet would to cross the boundaries of nationalist ideology and offer a true form of McLuhan's 'Global Village', reality has taken an ironic twist. Yet despite the existence of a Japanese term (*Netto-Uyoku*, ネット右翼, lit. 'Net Right') implying an electorate for anti-establishment right-wing populists in Japan, as well as the existence of various ultra-nationalist grassroots movements such as the Zaitokukai and the foundation of a populist political party fashioned in Trump's image (The Japan First Party), the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) retains its dominant grip on Japanese politics. My argument for that is twofold. While populist newcomers worldwide have capitalized on the distrust of established institutions experienced amongst these cyber-nationalists, the LDP has effectively done this several years earlier in the wake of the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ)'s waning popularity after the 2011 earthquake. On a macro-level, the LDP has spread its ideological hegemony in the state-sponsored Cool Japan form of soft-power both nationally and internationally, while on a micro-level the LDP appeals to Japanese cyber-nationalists by manufacturing outrage and exploiting the same self-perceived contradictions in society that have lead to counter-hegemonic movements elsewhere.

This paper attempts two things. First, it attempts to conceptualize the ideological notion of cyber-nationalism, a form of right-wing populist nationalism in which cyberspace takes a central position, as a globally applicable ideological element of a phenomenon that knows many regional namings (ranging from the Alt-Right in the United States, to the fachosphere in France and Netto-Uyoku in Japan). Secondly, it argues that

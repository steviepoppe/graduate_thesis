\begin{abstract}

\noindent Sinds de uitslag van enkele politieke gebeurtenissen sinds 2016, is er
een stijging aan academisch onderzoek rond de wereldwijde groei aan
neo-nationalisme en het aandeel van het internet daarin. Een deel van
dat onderzoek betreft een rechtse radicalisering onder
internetgebruikers, met name in enkele kleinere online `gemeenschappen'
waar een substantieel aandeel van politieke propaganda, verspreid op
onder meer Facebook en Twitter, ontstond. Propaganda die massaal
verspreid werd over platformen zoals Facebook en Twitter, inclusief door
voorname politici. Om dat aan te duiden, wordt er in hun
respectievelijke talen gesproken over de Amerikaanse alt-right, Franse
fachosphère en Japanse Netto-Uyoku (let. `Net-Rechts'), want ook in
Japan is er sprake van een dergelijk fenomeen. Deze paper tracht dat
globale fenomeen te conceptualiseren als cyber-nationalisme, een vorm
neo-nationalisme die niet enkel op het internet bestaat, maar ook door
de kenmerken van dat medium gevormd wordt. Om de logica achter dat
cyber-nationalisme te onthullen, baseren we ons op de theoretische
benadering van de notie `ideologie' door de zogenaamde Frankfurt School.
Zo zien we in de retoriek van cyber-nationalisten een Gramsciaanse
flair: het establishment, linkse instituties en de massamedia
representeren niet op voldoende wijze de wil van het volk, en leiden af
van `contradicties' in de maatschappij. Het internet representeert dan
een adequate `openbare sfeer' waarin contra-hegemonische ideologieën
kunnen verspreid worden.
\newline
\indent Deze paper betreft specifiek de Netto-Uyoku, en behandelt die als een
gelokaliseerde Japanse expressie van dergelijk cyber-nationalisme. Dat
doen we enerzijds met een literatuurstudie van voorname werken omtrent
de Netto-Uyoku en anderzijds met een kritische inhoudsanalyse van
platformen waarop zulke `contra-hegemonische ideologieën' worden
verspreid. Het cyber-nationalisme kunnen we koppelen aan steun voor
rechts-populistische politieke nieuwkomers, en ook in Japan is er sprake
van dergelijke nieuwkomers met politieke ambities (waaronder de
oprichter van de Zaitokukai, een extreemrechtse burgerbeweging gericht
op de in Japan aanwezige etnisch Koreaanse diaspora). Echter stellen we
ons dan de volgende vraag: waarom worden Netto-Uyoku als steungroep voor
de LDP en specifiek premier Abe Shinzō (iemand die in elke zin van het
woord het politiek establishment beademt) aanschouwd? Daarvoor stellen
we dat de LDP en Abe Shinzō in de nasleep van de aardbeving en kernramp
in 2011 de huidige golf aan rechts-populisme voorliepen. Concreet
stellen we dat: 1. de huidige instantie van de LDP succesvol inspeelde
op die golf aan cyber-nationalisme, door het medium van het internet en
dier dichotome relatie met massamedia te omhelzen, en 2. de ideologische
hegemonie verspreidde via de door de staat gesponsorde cultuurindustrie
(in de vorm van de `Cool Japan' soft-power) en aldus ook de Japanse
cyber-nationalisten niet onberoerd liet.

\begin{abstract}

\noindent それぞれの国の言語で主流となっている「オルタナ右翼」（alt-right）、「fachosphère」または「ネット右翼」（いわゆるネトウヨ）は、サイバー空間における右翼ポピュリズムの高揚あるいは右傾化に関連される現象を指している。本稿はこの現象をサイバーナショナリズムとして概念し、「ネット右翼」などの用語を地域的な表現として読まれている。そのために、本稿はまず「ネット右翼」に関する文献調査を行い、次にサイバーナショナリズムの理論的枠組みを構築を行っていく。最後に、本稿は「ネット右翼」に関連するSNSの混合研究法のコンテンツ分析を行う。
\newline
\indent 本稿の理論的枠組みは、西ドイツのフランクフルト学派の批判理論に基づき、そこから右翼ポピュリストのレトリック及び主題を解釈すると、グラムシ（Gramsci）の論理的な風味が明らかにされる。すなわち、既成の政治制度、左翼機関または主流メディアが果たしている役割とは「エリート」のヘゲモニー的（覇権的）イデオロギーに対して、道具的に「庶民」の同意を製造するものである。その上、その覇権的イデオロギーは（自己認識の）社会問題（すなわち、マリクスの矛盾）から逸脱され、「庶民」または「世論」を十分に代表していない。従って、るハーバーマス（Habermas）の公共圏と解釈されているインターネットは、カウンター（反覇権的イデオロギーの普及に好適だと思われる。
\newline
\indent しかしながら、（在特会を含むいわゆる保守行動運動の）さまざまな超国家主義的な市民運動が存在し、「ネット右翼」というその言葉自体がジャパンファースト党などの反体制派の右翼ポピュリストのために適切な有権者の存在を意味しているにもかかわらず、「ネット右翼」は自由民主党を指示している傾向が多く見える。本稿の概説は、2016年を特に、世界中にポピュリスト新参者が、サイバーナショナリストによって感じられる既成の政治制度、左翼期間または主流メディアへの不信を利用している一方で、自民党は
2011年の地震をきっかけにより早くそれを達成した。自民党が文化産業の「ソフトパワー」を通じて広めたヘゲモニー的イデオロギーは、
日本におけるサイバーナショナリストをそのままにしていない。さらに、自民党は公的憤懣を起こし、世の中におけるカウンター・ヘゲモニー的運動を達成している（自己認識の）社会的問題を利用して日本におけるサイバーナショナリストに訴えかけている。

\begin{abstract}

\noindent Terms such as \emph{alt-right}, \emph{fachosphère} and
\emph{Netto-Uyoku} have in their respective languages entered the
mainstream discourse and refer to a phenomenon of online-based
right-wing populist nationalism. This paper intends to conceptualize
this phenomenon as cyber-nationalism, adopting a mixed method
(quantitative and computer-assisted) content analysis to media-platforms
associated with the Japanese cyber-nationalists known as Netto-Uyoku.
\newline
\indent We find the Frankfurt School approach to ideological critique suitable
to theoretically ground our research. A reading of right-wing populist
rhetoric reveals a distinct flavor of Gramscian logic therein:
established politics, left-wing institutions and mainstream media
manufacture consent to the hegemonic ideology of the elite, which does
not adequately represent the people's will and defers from
self-perceived contradictions in society. The Internet as an imagined
public sphere is then ideal for disseminating counter-hegemonic
ideologies.
\newline
\indent Yet despite the existence of ultra-nationalist grassroots movements such
as the Zaitokukai, and the term Netto-Uyoku itself implying a prevalent
electorate for Japanese right-wing populists as Sakurai Makoto, the
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has retained its grip on politics. For
this, we hypothesize that while populist newcomers have on a global
scale capitalized on the distrust of established institutions
experienced by these cyber-nationalists, the LDP has effectively done
this earlier in the wake of the 2011 earthquake. We then find two
elements contributing to the LDP's success amongst Japanese
cyber-nationalists: 1.) the ideological hegemony spread by the LDP
through the state-sponsored soft-power of its culture industry has not
left Japanese cyber-nationalists untouched; and 2.) the LDP appeals to
Japanese cyber-nationalists by manufacturing victimization and
exploiting the same self-perceived contradictions in society that have
led to counter-hegemonic movements elsewhere.

\section*{要約}

本稿の目的は、日本における「ネット右翼」の背景にある「ロジック」を明らかにすることである。2016年アメリカ大統領選挙およびイギリスの欧州連合離脱（いわゆる「ブレグジット」）に関する国民投票が予想外の結果を示した以来、新ナショナリズム（ネオ・ナショナリズム）\footnote{言い換えれば、右派ポピュリズト的で、排外主義的なナショナリズムである。}の世界的な成長、またはその中でのインターネットの影響に関する学術研究が活発に行われてきた。この研究の一部は、インターネット利用者の右傾化に対し、特に多くの政治的プロパガンダが見られるいくつかの「オンライン・コミュニティ」に焦点を当てている。そのプロパガンダはまた、著名な政治家を含む、FacebookやTwitterなどのユーザーにより大量に普及されていた(Zannettou
et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-zannettou_origins_2018}{2018})。日本でも、こういう傾向が見られる。その一例として、Schäfer,
Evert, and Heinrich (\protect\hyperlink{ref-schafer_japans_2017}{2017})
は２０１４年総選挙の際、Twitterでつぶやかされた「ツイート」において、bot\footnote{botとはこの文脈で自動アルゴリズムを示しているものである。}により広まった多量の右翼的発言または自由民主党（以下より、自民党と称する）を支持する内容が存在する可能性を提示している。このような事柄を特徴付けるため、それぞれ国において「alt-right」（
アメリカ）「 fachosphère」（フランス）「ネット右翼
」（日本）などの用語が新しく現れ、通用されている。

第一章（序章）では
、そのインターネットにおける右傾化現象を「サイバーナショナリズム」と定義し、「オルタナ右翼」や「ネット右翼」などの用語は、このサイバーナショナリズムを称する各地域・国家の固有的表現として位置づけている。

「サイバーナショナリズム」は、ただインターネットにおける「新ナショナリズム」\footnote{言い換えれば、右派ポピュリズト的で、排外主義的なナショナリズムである。}だけではなく、「インターネット」のメディア自体に対するイデオロギー（いわゆる、マスメディアと対比する新しいメディアの理屈）によっても形成されている。世界中におけるサイバーナショナリズムは、右翼ポピュリストの新人政治家への支援に結びついている。その上に、日本では「在日特権を許さない市民の会」（以下、在特会と称する）\footnote{桜井誠に設立され、主に在日韓国・朝鮮人を中心にする自称市民団体である。反差別機関に多く批判され、平成２９年に最高裁判所でヘートスピーチとされる言葉に関する損害賠償が確定された。}を含むいわゆる「行動する保守運動」のさまざまな新ナショナリストの市民運動が存在する。そうであれば、サイバー・ナショナリズムの表現とする「ネット右翼」も「日本第一党」\footnote{「日本第一党」とは、在特会の桜井誠がトランプ大統領のレトリックをものまねにした政治団体である。2017の東京都議会議員選挙に立候補し、落選した。}のような反体制の右翼ポピュリスト党に対する、適切な有権者の存在を意味しているはずだ。しかしながら、それにもかかわらず「ネット右翼」は政治的新人ではなく、既存の自由民主党を支持している傾向が多く見られる。

本稿の仮説は、特に2016年に入ってから、世界中において、右翼ポピュリストの政治新参者が、サイバー・ナショナリストが感じていた既存の政治制度、いわゆる「左翼機関」\footnote{この用法は、主に大学などの教育機関をしみしている。}または主流メディアに対する不信を利用している一方で、自民党は２０１１年の地震をきっかけに2012年の選挙でその不信の利をより早く達成したことである。以上を踏まえ、本稿では、より具体的に２つの仮説を提案する。1．現在の自民党はインターネットメディア（SNS）とそこから読み取られるマスメディアへの対立を利用し、日本中のサイバー・ナショナリストたちに支持を訴えかけている。２.さらに、自民党が文化産業（Culture
Industry）を通じて広めた「ソフトパワー」（すなわち、ヘゲモニー的イデオロギー）は、日本のサイバーナショナリストたちの思想の形成にも影響を与えている。

第二章では、ネット右翼についての先行研究のレビューを行う。ネット右翼に関する研究は、大きく3つのテーマで分類される。1．Twitterや「2ちゃんねる」\footnote{２ちゃんねるとは平成11年西村博之により開設された匿名な電子掲示板である。平成２９年してから「5ちゃんねる」に名付けられたにも関わず、以前の文献とのつながりのため、本稿は「２ちゃんねる」の名を利用し続ける。}などのソーシャルメディアにおけるネット右翼の思考過程に対する修辞的分析(辻，
\protect\hyperlink{ref-tsuji_eng:_2008}{2008}; 辻，
\protect\hyperlink{ref-tsuji_eng._2017}{2017}; 高，
\protect\hyperlink{ref-taka_twitter_2015}{2015}\protect\hyperlink{ref-taka_twitter_2015}{a};
高，
\protect\hyperlink{ref-taka_twitter_2015-1}{2015}\protect\hyperlink{ref-taka_twitter_2015-1}{b})。2．ネット右翼と在特会を含む新ナショナリストの市民運動との関係(安田，
\protect\hyperlink{ref-yasuda_eng:_2012}{2012}; 山口，
\protect\hyperlink{ref-yamaguchi_xenophobia_2013}{2013}; Morris-Suzuki，
\protect\hyperlink{ref-morris-suzuki_freedom_2013}{2013}; 樋口，
\protect\hyperlink{ref-higuchi_japans_2014}{2014}; Gill，
\protect\hyperlink{ref-gill_nativist_2018}{2018})3．ネット右翼の出現に対する理論的アプローチ(東，
\protect\hyperlink{ref-azuma_otaku:_2001}{2001}; 北田，
\protect\hyperlink{ref-kitada_eng:_2005}{2005}; Sakamoto，
\protect\hyperlink{ref-sakamoto_koreans_2011}{2011}; 村井，
\protect\hyperlink{ref-murai_net_2012}{2012})。

辻大介は大きく３つの特徴を持つとしてネット右翼を定義する(\protect\hyperlink{ref-tsuji_eng:_2008}{2008};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-tsuji_eng._2017}{2017})：

1． 主に中国と韓国に対する排外主義 2．
憲法改正や靖国神社への公式参拝などへのナショナリズムに対する支持 3．
ネット上に自分の政治的な意見を投稿すること

辻の2008年の調査によると、調査の参加者の約1％がその3つの要件を満たし、2014年行われた同調査では、それは2％である(\protect\hyperlink{ref-tsuji_eng:_2008}{2008};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-tsuji_eng._2017}{2017})。
辻はまた、潜在的なネット右翼行動（すなわち、投稿せず特徴１と２に賛成するだけの行動）の増加を主張し、匿名SNS選好度とニコニコ動画・2ちゃんねるの使用頻度の間の相関関係を明らかにしている。

本稿は、辻の3つの特徴に、このネット右翼のつながりを維持させるもう一つの特徴として、「マスメディアへの不信」を付け加える。北田暁大(\protect\hyperlink{ref-kitada_eng:_2005}{2005})は2ちゃんねるなどの匿名電子掲示板を「皮肉の共同体」と名付け、その電子掲示板における右傾化が「つながりの社会性」（「つながり」を希求）の結果の1つであると主張している。要するに、コミュニケーション環境が対面からネットへ移行されることで、
「内輪」で感じられる連帯感を保つため、
コミュニケーション自体が目的になる。2ちゃんねるでは、インターネット空間と対置するマスメディアを敢えて批判することで、そのコミュニケーションより共同体意識が生まれてくるということである。

サカモト・ルミ(\protect\hyperlink{ref-sakamoto_koreans_2011}{2011})と村井秀輔(\protect\hyperlink{ref-murai_net_2012}{2012})は2ちゃんねるとニコニコ動画におけるネット右翼の投稿の構造を分析した。彼らまた、Anderson
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-anderson_imagined_2006}{2006})、北田が指摘したように、2ちゃんねるのような匿名のSNSでは、インターネットスラングを含む書き込みの書き方により、「想像の共同体」が築かれていると述べている。高史明(\protect\hyperlink{ref-taka_twitter_2015}{2015}\protect\hyperlink{ref-taka_twitter_2015}{a};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-taka_twitter_2015-1}{2015}\protect\hyperlink{ref-taka_twitter_2015-1}{b})は、Twitterにおける中国人と「コリアン」についての日本語のツイートを収集し、計量的分析を行った。その結果では、多くのツイートはネガティブ傾向であり、少数のユーザーにより投稿され、２ちゃんねるや「２ちゃんねるまとめブログ」への引用が含まれる確率も小さくないことが明らかになった。

安田浩一(\protect\hyperlink{ref-yasuda_eng:_2012}{2012})、山口智美(\protect\hyperlink{ref-yamaguchi_xenophobia_2013}{2013})と樋口直人(\protect\hyperlink{ref-higuchi_japans_2014}{2014})は、ネット右翼を主に在特会のような新ナショナリストの市民運動グループと関連付けている。これらのグループは、いわゆる「右翼団体」と特徴付けられる過激なナショナリズム団体と同一線上に立ち、しばしば外国人、グローバリズム、マスコミと左翼政治家をターゲットにする傾向が多い。これらの団体は抗議行動のビデオをインターネットに投稿し、また2ちゃんねるやニコニコ動画などのSNSを利用し自分たちのメッセージを広めている。それは、ただインターネットを利用し、自分のメッセージを広めるだけではない。たとえば、在特会の創始者である「桜井誠」の存在そのものはそのサイバー空間における右派の過激化の結果物とも言える。

在特会をはじめ、新ナショナリストの市民運動は2014年以降急激に減少している様子だが、
その背後にある右翼の感情も減少したわけではない。すなわち、自民党による朝日新聞やNHKなどのマスメディアへの攻撃から、早い段階で特にYouTubeよりオタク系動画共有サイトの「ニコニコ動画」で生放送を行うことによって直接ネット利用者に訴える行為に至るまで、自民党とネット右翼の間になんらかの共通点が見られるという事実から見ると、在特会のような団体の必要性が少なくなったのではないか。

第三章は、ネット右翼の背後にあるサイバーナショナリズムのロジックを明らかにするために、「ネオ・マルクス主義」の主唱者の「イデオロギー」への理論的アプローチを採用する。右翼ポピュリストのレトリックを解釈することで、特にグラムシの論理的な風潮が明らかにされる。すなわち、ネット右翼を含むサイバーナショナリズストにより、既存の政治制度、左翼のイデオロギーまたはマスコミが果たしている役割とは「エリート」のヘゲモニー的イデオロギーにしたがって、道具的に「庶民」の同意を作り出すことである。さらに、
そのヘゲモニー的イデオロギーは（自己認識の）社会における「矛盾」から逸脱され、「庶民」または「世論」を十分に代表していない。それに対して、ハーバーマスにより公共圏（public
sphere）として解釈されているインターネットは、カウンター（反覇権的）イデオロギーの創造と普及に最適だと思われている。インターネットをめぐるそのような見解は、インターネット、特にワールドワイドウェブの起源にまで遡ることができる。マルコフ(\protect\hyperlink{ref-markoff_what_2005}{2005})は、インターネットとワールドワイドウェブの開発を、1960年時代の反独裁的、自由主義的なカウンターカルチャー思想から胎動され、実現につながったと考えている。このような背景から、地理的な境界から切り離された「サイバースペース」としてのインターネットの概念的空間が提起され、ワールドワイドウェブの背後にある「マスコミへの対抗」の思想をもたらした。それはまた、ばるぼら・さやわか(\protect\hyperlink{ref-barubora_eng:_2017}{2017})が言っているように1980年代、アメリカにおける「西海岸思想」または「カリフォルニア思想」として、技術関連雑誌を通じて広まった。

しかし、上記の対照的な思考は、右翼ポピュリズムの繁殖地であり、そして、ネット右翼が広がるカウンター・イデオロギーとは新ナショナリズムである。東浩紀(\protect\hyperlink{ref-azuma_otaku:_2001}{2001})とばるぼら・さやわか(\protect\hyperlink{ref-barubora_eng:_2017}{2017})は日本におけるインターネットまたはワールドワイドウェブの発展とアニメやビデオゲームといったサブカルチャー（いわゆるオタク分化）の関連は少なくないと述べている。さらに、東浩紀は、日本のナショナリズムは生き残る過程でオタク化されたと指摘している。\footnote{「したがってそれはまた政治やイデオロギーの問題とも深く関係している。たとえば、冷戦崩壊後のこの一二年間、小林よしのりや福田和也から鳥肌実にいたるまで、日本の右翼的言説は一般にサブカルチャー化しフェイク化しオタク化することで生き残ってきたとも言える」(\protect\hyperlink{ref-azuma_ippan_2011}{2011},
  23)。}これはアドルノとホルクハイマーの文化産業の理論（すなわち、ヘゲモニー的イデオロギーの合意に達するための消費物化される文化の使用）と重なることとも言える。
そして、そのサブカルチャーに集中する自民党の「クールジャパン」政策における国主導型のソフトパワー（または、麻生太郎の自称おたく発言や、
安部晋三の、ネット右翼とよく関連付けられるオタク系のニコニコ動画の使用など）はさらにヘゲモニー的イデオロギーを広めることに一助している役割を果たしているのではないだろうか。

第四章は、ネット右翼の間に広まっている「カウンター・ヘゲモニー的イデオロギー」を、いくつかの主要インターネットプラットフォームを対象とし、コンテンツ分析を行う。そのため、本章ではメディア学者マクルーハンの「メディアはメッセージである」という主張に基づき、分析を進める。マクルーハンによると、メッセージ（情報）は、コンテンツだけではなく、メディア（情報媒体）そのものも含めているという。要するに、メッセージの内容は、そのメッセージを含むメディアにより、その解釈も変わるとのことである。本章では、第三章で挙げた「インターネット発展の背後の存在するイデオロギー」とメディア（この場合、SNSやインターネットプラットフォーム）の構造の影響力を両方考慮しながら、分析を行う。

いわゆる「まとめサイト」とは、2ちゃんねるなどで人気のある特定のトピックに沿って、情報を収集、編集したウェブサイトのことを言う。まとめサイトはしばしば営利を目的として広告に頼っているため、

これを嫌った2ちゃんねるのユーザーらがそれに対する対抗として、営利目的でコンテンツ収集ができない2ちゃんねるの部分（「嫌儲」といういわゆる板）を設立し、自分のアイデンティティとそこで感じられるコミュニティーの特性を規定したとも言える。さらに、特に保守的傾向がよく見られるまとめサイトでは、\footnote{例：「保守速報」、「もえるあじあ」、「
  キムチ速報」や「笑韓ブログ」}｢オーナーが慎重に選択したネット右翼的コンテンツを世論（「ネットの声」として受け止めるケースも少なくない。また、まとめサイトの伝播力について過小評価してはいけない。なぜなら、数百万人に達するインターネットユーザーが日本語版ネット掲示板以外に（日本のソフトパワーを元にした）翻訳され、英語や他の言語の掲示板へアクセスし、影響を受けている可能性もあるからだ。\footnote{他人がそれらのユーザーの2ちゃんねるでの書き込みを利用して金儲けすることが嫌うことをしみ示す。ネット右翼と繋がる「嫌韓」に言及。}

さて、日本だけでなく、世界で最も使用されているサイト上位１０の一つであるユーザーコンテンツに基づくウィキペディアでも、ネット右翼と2ちゃんねるの影響が明確に見えてくる。本章は、日本語版のウィキペディアのデータベース最新版のコピーをもとに、格ページのリビジョン（改訂）の総数、リビジョンの中の取り消し（いわゆるrevert）の総数、とそのページの「論争レベル」（本章では、リビジョン数を取り消し数で割ったもの）を計算した。リビジョン数、取り消し数、および「論争レベル」といった3つのカテゴリーを設定した。その3つのカテゴリーにおける上位50の記事は主にサブカルチャー（ポップカルチャーとも言える）のトピックと関連していることがわかった。\footnote{具体的には、「ワンピース」というアニメとアイドル文化の「AKB48」に関連するトピックが多かった。詳細はテーブル\ref{fig:anon-wiki}}

ウィキペディアの共同創始者であるジミー・ウェールズも、日本語版のウィキペディアにポップカルチャー関連のトピックと他のトピックとの間に明確な格差があると指摘した(Cohen
\protect\hyperlink{ref-cohen_wikipedia_2009}{2009})。そして、ウィキペディアの匿名の変更数が世界平均をはるかに超えているという事実も、\footnote{詳細はテーブル\ref{tab:50expanded}}2ちゃんねるとの重複を示唆していないのだろうか。その一方、取り消し数が高いカテゴリーと「論争レベル」が高いカテゴリー両方においては、サブカルチャーと関係ない記事も見られる。特に「論争レベル」が高いカテゴリーでは、「南京事件」（第１位）、「ネット右翼」（第2位）と、「日本」（第3位）\footnote{他は例えば、「安倍晋三」（第１１位）、「鳩山由紀夫」（第１３位）、「中華民国」（第１６位）、「金妍兒」（第１８位）、「在特会を許さない市民の会」（第１９位）、「在日韓国・朝鮮人」（第２１位）や「朝日新聞」（第２６位）である。}の記事が際立っている。\footnote{荒らし行為の恐れが高い記事が管理者以外保護できない場合もある。}その中で小グループのウィキペディアユーザーがさまざまな成功を収めて記事のトーンを変更しようとする現象があり、明らかになったのは中立性を保護するユーザーもネット右翼の傾向があるユーザーも、2ちゃんねるとの関連が少なくないことである。さらに、特にネット右翼の傾向があるユーザーはサブカルチャーの記事でも活動し、日本語版だけではなく、英語版のウィキペディアでも変更しようとする傾向が見える。

しかし、同じ2ちゃんねるでは、上記に述べた「嫌儲」の「板」を含む、\footnote{他は、元々野球に関する「なんJ」または、韓国に関する「ハンJ」。}ネット右翼を批判するコミュニティーも明確に存在する。それらにおける政治的な理想にもかかわらず、明らかなのは、北田(\protect\hyperlink{ref-kitada_eng:_2005}{2005})が述べた通りそのコミュニティーにおける「アイロニー」である。そのコミュニティは、「ネトウヨBAN祭り」を始め、要するにTwitterやYoutubeなどのさまざまなプラットフォームの通報方法‎を利用し、数千のアカウント、数十万のメッセージやビデオを報告し、それらを「不適切な」発言として削除を求める。

今後の課題は、ネット右翼と関連されるプラットフォームの技術的側面とそのプラットフォームで感じられる共同体意識の間の関係をより深く調査することである。また、この調査を、特に韓国と中国でのサイバーナショナリズムの表現へ拡張することも必要である。それらのサイバーナショナリスト（すなわち、中国と韓国の「ネット右翼」）はまた、日本のネット右翼の「嫌韓中」の形成に重要な役割を果たすことも言える。

On August 28, 2010 \emph{The New York Times} published an article titled
``New Dissent in Japan Is Loudly Anti-Foreign,'' referring to a rise in
politically motivated protest marches associated with a supposed
Japanese `Net-Right'. In his article, Martin Fackler describes this
`Net-Right' (hereinafter referred to by its Japanese term
\emph{Netto-Uyoku} ネット右翼)\footnote{This paper will retain the
  Japanese term in order to differentiate it as a localized expression
  of a larger phenomenon. This usage has since 2009 been overtaken by
  the more pejorative four-character abbreviation \emph{neto-uyo}
  (ネトウヨ). when deemed necessary, during translations of texts using
  this pejorative abbreviation, \emph{neto-uyo} will be used
  instead.} as ``a new type of ultranationalist group'' and ``a virtual
community.'' He goes on to state that ``while these groups remain a
small if noisy fringe element here, they have won growing attention as
an alarming side effect of Japan's long economic and political decline''
(Fackler \protect\hyperlink{ref-fackler_new_2010-1}{2010}). Yet it is a
small fringe element that is nevertheless noisy enough to reach print
press in the United States. In its most commonly applied form the term for this small fringe element,
Netto-Uyoku, applies to a loosely connected, decentralized group of
Internet users disseminating a form of extreme right-wing discourse
online and who are active primarily on social media platforms such as
Twitter, the anonymous messaging board 2channel (\emph{2-channeru}
2ちゃんねる),\footnote{Albeit in October 2017 renamed to 5channel
  (\emph{5-channeru} 5ちゃんねる), this paper will for the sake of
  continuity with previous literature, refer to this message board as
  2channel. Online, the distinction `5ch (\emph{kyū} 旧2ch)' is more commonly seen.}
and streaming services such as YouTube and Niconico
(ニコニコ).\footnote{In this paper, social media refers to all online
  platforms used for computer-mediated communication in which a sense of
  community or interactivity can grow.}

Far from benign expressions of free speech limited to shadowy corners of
the Internet, consequences of such outings have however very much
crossed digital boundaries and materialized in disquieting, at times
even violent ways. As Fackler alluded to in his \emph{New York Times}
piece, the Netto-Uyoku are often name-called in the same breath as
neo-nationalist movements like the \emph{Zaitokukai} and
\emph{Shukenkai}\footnote{Respectively ``The Group Seeking Recovery of
  Sovereignty'' (\emph{Shuken Kaifuku o Mezasu Kai} 主権回復を目指す会)
  and ``The Citizens' Group Refusing to Tolerate Special Rights for
  Zainichi Koreans'' (\emph{Zainichi Tokken o Yurusanai Shimin no Kai}
  在日特権を許さない市民の会).}---or to use the jargon of those
movements, \emph{Action Conservative Movements} (ACM).\footnote{Although
  Higuchi and Castelvetere
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-higuchi_japans_2016}{2016}) describe the ACM
  as ultra-nationalist in nature, this paper agrees with Gill
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-gill_nativist_2018}{2018}) in that ``\,`ultra'
  implies a \emph{quantitative} increase in the degree of extremism,
  from `right' to `far right' to `ultra-right'.'' It will instead
  utilize the term neo-nationalism to distinguish the ACM from
  ultra-nationalist Japanese militants collectively known as \emph{uyoku
  dantai} (右翼団体, ``right wing groups''). While often used in the
  context of Europe and North-America's rise in populism, the term
  neo-nationalism refers to a type of nationalism marked by right-wing
  populism, cultural racism, anti-globalism and nativism, and
  arguably more closely describes the ACM ideologically (Dougherty
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-dougherty_new_2016}{2016}; Hirsh
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-hirsh_why_2016}{2016}).} Furthermore, according
to a 2016 investigation by the Japanese department of Justice, between the period April 2012
and September 2015 a total
of 1152 protest marches, xenophobic in nature and associated with the
ACM, were held across Japan (Nikaido
\protect\hyperlink{ref-nikaido_eng:_2016}{2016}). Makoto Sakurai,
founder of the Zaitokukai and one key figure associated with the ACM and
Netto-Uyoku, has been arrested for violence associated with such protest
marches, stepping down as its leader in 2014. He did however remain a
prolific political commentator online, going on to form the populist
right-wing Japan First Party in 2016 and holding their first convention in
a hotel of the equally controversial Toshio Motoya owned APA
Group.\footnote{According to the \emph{New York Times}, controversy
  concerns the owners' denial of war crimes and promotion of historical
  revisionist literature through distribution in their budget hotels
  (Soble \protect\hyperlink{ref-soble_right-wing_2017}{2017}).}

Nevertheless, nearly a decade after Fackler's publication in \emph{The
New York Times}, academic coverage of the Netto-Uyoku and related topics
such as the ACM and Zaitokukai remains relatively scarce, with some
exceptions including the seminal work \emph{Netto to Aikoku}
(ネットと愛国, ``The Internet and Patriotism'') by journalist Yasuda
Koichi (\protect\hyperlink{ref-yasuda_eng:_2012}{2012}), and publications by
Tsuji (\protect\hyperlink{ref-tsuji_eng:_2008}{2008}), Sakamoto
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-sakamoto_koreans_2011}{2011}), Murai
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-murai_net_2012}{2012}), Yamaguchi
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-yamaguchi_xenophobia_2013}{2013}), Higuchi
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-higuchi_japans_2014}{2014}) and Schäfer, Evert,
and Heinrich (\protect\hyperlink{ref-schafer_japans_2017}{2017}).
Moreover, whenever the topic does reach mainstream outlets, there
appears to be a tendency to frame the Netto-Uyoku as little more than a
fringe `movement' and side-effect of economic malaise with little
real-life influence (Tsunehira Furuya
\protect\hyperlink{ref-furuya_roots_2016}{2016}\protect\hyperlink{ref-furuya_roots_2016}{a}).\footnote{A
  conservative Nippon Foundation platform \emph{nippon.com} English
  language publication by author Furuya Tsunehiro (a cultural critic,
  online personality and until 2014 himself a frequent guest on Channel
  Sakurai). He claims that ``disturbing as the voice of cyber-extremism
  may be, its influence on Japanese politics and society remains
  limited, and its heyday is nearing an end'' (Tsunehira Furuya
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-furuya_roots_2016}{2016}\protect\hyperlink{ref-furuya_roots_2016}{a}).
  The platform is part of the Sasakawa Peace Foundation, founded by
  World Anti-Communist League (WACL) member Sasakawa Ryōichi (Kirkup
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-kirkup_obituary:_1995}{1995}).} This is in
spite of the fact that, as shown above, actions associated with this
phenomenon have had real-life consequences, not the least of which
includes the 2016 adoption of an anti-discrimination law in order to
curb hate speech.\footnote{This refers to the \emph{`Honpō-gai shusshin-sha ni taisuru
  futōna sabetsu-teki gendō no kaishō ni muketa torikumi no suishin ni
  kansuru
  hōritsu'} (「本邦外出身者に対する不当な差別的言動の解消に向けた取組の推進に関する法律」,
  ``Law on Promotion of Efforts to Resolve Unfair Discriminatory Speech
  and Conduct to Foreign Residents in Japan'').} Additionally, a 2017
paper on political bots in Japan suggests a hidden nationalist agenda of
Prime Minister Abe Shinzō tied to that of the Netto-Uyoku, and views
them as a potential ``enormous online support army of Abe's agenda''
(Schäfer, Evert, and Heinrich
\protect\hyperlink{ref-schafer_japans_2017}{2017}, 1), something that
the author of this paper too has previously alluded to.\footnote{This
  paper expands upon the author's undergraduate thesis (Poppe
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-poppe_digitaal_2017}{2017}), written under the
  supervision of Prof.~Dr.~Dimitri Vanoverbeke. In his undergraduate
  thesis, the author examined the Netto-Uyoku as potential electorate of
  populist politicians on both a national and regional scale.}
Furthermore, to prove the extent the term has penetrated the mainstream
discourse, a political booklet handed out to LDP lawmakers in the Diet
before the July 2019 election was in a 2019 interview with Ishiba
Shigeru (former Minister of Defense and political rival to Abe Shinzō)
explicitly criticized as a `Netto-Uyoku book' (Bungeishunjū editorial
department
\protect\hyperlink{ref-bungeishunju_editorial_department_eng._2019}{2019}).\footnote{The
  booklet is titled \emph{``Feiku jōhō ga mushibamu Nippon tondemo yatō
  to media no hijōshiki''}
  (『フェイク情報が蝕むニッポン　トンデモ野党とメディアの非常識』, ``The
  Japan that is being eroded by fake news --- the absurdity of the
  opposition and media''). According to \emph{the Huffington Post}, the
  booklet contained harsh critique of \emph{Asahi shinbun} and
  \emph{Mainichi shinbun} as ``outrageous newspapers'' (\emph{`Tondemo
  shinbun'} 「トンデモ新聞」) as well as cartoon caricatures of the
  opposition leaders of the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan,
  Social Democratic Party and Communist Party (Tanaka
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-tanaka_eng._2019}{2019}).} Although the
publisher of this booklet, Internet media-website TerracePRESS, claims
to have been widely viewed since its establishment one year prior, the
\emph{Huffington Post Japan} reports there was no data available on
monthly visits (indicating that the number was too low too include) and
that the meta-data of its website blocks it from being indexed by
search-engines such as Google (Tanaka
\protect\hyperlink{ref-tanaka_eng._2019}{2019}).

It goes without saying that expressions of neo-nationalist sentiment
taking place largely within the confines of cyberspace are by no means
limited to Japanese territory. First of all, the outcome of the United
States' 2016 presidential elections, the 2016 British Brexit-referendum
and the rise of neo-nationalist ideology amongst various European
political campaigns reflect greater global political struggles. We can
next argue that the role of the Internet, social media and software was
of no small importance in those outcomes either, considering the extent
it penetrated our daily lives. Facebook, for example, came under strong
public scrutiny in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal (in
which it came to light that illicitly obtained personal data of up to 87
million Facebook users was used for political advertising and
data-analysis in favor of Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and
the British Leave.EU campaign).\footnote{The company has been involved
  with other international political campaigns, and was backed by the
  conservative computer scientist Robert Mercer, an important financial
  contributor to Breitbart News (Kang and Frenkel
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-kang_facebook_2018}{2018}; Rosenberg,
  Confessore, and Cadwalladr
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-rosenberg_how_2019}{2019}).}

Moreover, backing the cult of personality of presidents Vladimir Putin,
Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Xi Jinping, to name a few, as well as the 2016
elected president of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte, are supposed
`online troll armies'. These `troll armies' deliberately, and both on a
voluntary or paid basis, spread disinformation on social media and
attack self-perceived enemies of their respective presidents. They have
on multiple instances been accredited with manipulation of political
discourse online in order to influence elections, including in more
recent memory the 2016 presidential elections in the United States
(Benedictus \protect\hyperlink{ref-benedictus_invasion_2016}{2016}). This is a
practice Marko Kovic defined (specifically in the case of state-sponsored Internet
propaganda) as `digital \emph{astroturfing}', calling it ``a form of
manufactured, deceptive and strategic top-down activity on the Internet
initiated by political actors that mimics bottom-up activity by
autonomous individuals''
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-kovic_digital_2018}{2018}, 71).

Furthermore, the \emph{Alt-Right} (arguably the western counterparts to
the Netto-Uyoku and associated primarily with the United States) have
drawn much ire after a white nationalist terror attack
(i.e.~ideologically driven violence) in Charlottesville, Virginia during
its Unite the Right rally,\footnote{The Southern Poverty Law Center
  reports that although global ``terrorist attacks dropped from about
  17,000 in 2014 to about 11,000 in 2017 {[}\ldots{}{]} the United
  States has seen a recent surge in terror-related violence, with 65
  attacks {[}in 2017{]}, up from six in 2006,'' with two-third ``tied to
  racist, anti-Muslim, homophobic, anti-Semitic, fascist,
  anti-government or xenophobic motivations'' (Morlin
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-morlin_study_2018}{2018}).} and again after
little public disavowal by the President of the United States.\footnote{After
  the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, The term Alt-Lite
  occasionally came into usage to differentiate its relatively moderate
  members from more extremist white-nationalist Alt-Right members such
  as Richard Spencer (Nagle
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-nagle_kill_2017}{2017}). When referring to the
  Alt-Right in this paper, we use the term as an overarching
  umbrella term indicating both.} In a similar fashion and overlapping
ideologically with the Alt-Right, we then find associated foremost with
(Western) Europe, Australia and New Zealand the so-called
\emph{Identitarian Movement}. It should be noted too that the
perpetrator of the March 2019 terror attack in New Zealand sprinkled his
manifesto with deeply ironic Internet-driven subculture rhetoric
inherent to those movements. During the terror attack, he referenced, for example, an
online trend concerning Swedish YouTube influencer Felix Khellberg
(known for making video-game related videos through his online handler
\emph{PewDiePie} and as of writing subscribed to by over 95 million
followers). Moreover, in his manifesto the perpetrator describes himself
as ``just an ordinary White (\emph{sic}) man, 28 years old'' and
references a white supremacy conspiracy theory popularized by Alt-Right
YouTube influencer and Canadian far-right Internet media-platform The
Rebel Media contributor Lauren Southern.\footnote{This theory, known as
  ``The Great Replacement'' (not coincidentally the title of the
  perpetrator's manifesto), is featured on the Identitarian Movement's
  homepage and has been adopted by populist right-wing figures such as
  Dutch politician Geert Wilders and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor
  Orbán. It has arguably been endorsed by the President of the United
  States Donald Trump, who has shared tweets with the hashtag
  ``\#whitegenocide'' (Weiss and Winter
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-weiss_opinion_2018}{2018}; Manjoo
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-manjoo_opinion_2019}{2019}).}

In Belgium, the mid-2019 elected politician Dries van Langenhove
(aligned with the right-wing populist party Vlaams Belang, lit. `Flemish
Interest') also acquired attention, through his mimicry of rhetoric used
by online-based far-right nationalist movements including the Alt-Right,
on platforms as Facebook and gaming chat application Discord (which was
brought to light in a 2018 documentary on the Belgian Identitarian youth
movement \emph{Schild \& Vrienden}).\footnote{Translates to `Shield \&
  Friends', a reference to a period of Flemish romantic nationalism (the
  Battle of the Golden Spurs) and in particular to the \nth{14} century
  shibboleth for identifying Frenchmen based on their inability to
  pronounce this phrase.} The second largest party in Belgium after the
2019 elections, Vlaams Belang's online campaign took inspiration from
both the 2016 Brexit campaign and Trump campaign, investing predominantly
in social media advertisements and targeting young voters aged 18 to 34
(Cerulus \protect\hyperlink{ref-cerulus_inside_2019}{2019}).
Furthermore, in another intersection with the Alt-Right, Vlaams Belang
leader Tom Van Grieken hosted an event debating the UN migration pact
with, amongst others, Steve Bannon (Gotev
\protect\hyperlink{ref-gotev_vlaams_2018}{2018}), and a youth
subdivision of Vlaams Belang invited Lauren Southern as guest-speaker
during another congress supervised by Van Grieken (Rennenberg
\protect\hyperlink{ref-rennenberg_vlaams_2018}{2018}). In France, the
term \emph{fachosphère} denotes similar trends on the French Internet. On that topic, \emph{Le Monde} published a series of articles 
connecting Marine Le Pen's populist far-right Front National, online
video-game community jeuxvideo.com and `Internet trolls' (Laurent
\protect\hyperlink{ref-laurent_nordactu_2016}{2016}; Audureau
\protect\hyperlink{ref-audureau_les_2017}{2017}).\footnote{In the second
  article, Laurent (\protect\hyperlink{ref-laurent_nordactu_2016}{2016})
  describes the \emph{fachosphère} as part of the Identitarian Movement
  and ``\emph{une nébuleuse de sites, de comptes sur les réseaux
  sociaux, visant à diffuser de la « réinformation », en clair de la
  propagande allant dans le sens des militants qui les animent}.'' A
  nebula of websites and accounts on social networks, designed to
  disseminate `\emph{réinformation}', or in other words propaganda
  embracing the ideas of the activists, amongst the users of those
  platforms.} In South Korea, the populist far-right Liberty Korea Party
(LKP) has been condemned for its usage of `online Internet trolls'.
Furthermore, its former chairman, previous presidential candidate and
YouTuber Hong Joon-Pyo has seen comparisons to Donald Trump (He-rim
\protect\hyperlink{ref-he-rim_firebrand_2018}{2018}; Bo-gyung
\protect\hyperlink{ref-bo-gyung_youtube_2019}{2019}). Finally, the
online media-platform Ilbe Storage is described as hosting the South
Korean equivalent of the Japanese Netto-Uyoku (Shim
\protect\hyperlink{ref-shim_hardcore_2015}{2015}).

Whether or not the actions of those online movements have had any
measurable effect on the outcome of the elections is wholly debatable,
but in light of the above information, it is at the very least sensible
to claim that the Internet as a medium plays an undeniably important role,
not just in the organization of neo-nationalist movements, but in
shaping elements of its discourse as well; a narrative that is
increasingly amplified by numerous mainstream news outlets. One Politico
reporter states that ``just about everyone else, if they're aware of
these efforts at all, assumes they amounted to little more than
entertainment for bored geeks and some unpleasant episodes for the
targets of its often racist and sexist harassment campaigns. After all,
the idea that a swarm of socially alienated trolls played a meaningful
role in a multibillion-dollar presidential campaign by, among other
gambits, relentlessly spreading images of a cartoon frog is at least as
ridiculous as the idea that a billionaire TV entertainer could win that
campaign'' (Schreckinger
\protect\hyperlink{ref-schreckinger_world_2017}{2017}).\footnote{For
  other mainstream news examples, see \emph{The New York Times}'
  \emph{How The Trolls Stole Washington}
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-hess_how_2017}{2017}) and the \emph{Washington
  Post}'s \emph{We Actually Elected A Meme As President} (Ohlheiser
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-ohlheiser_analysis_2016}{2016}).}

Furthermore, Japan's international \emph{soft power} (non-coercive
political influence) has in no doubt left its mark on many of those
communities abroad, seeping particularly into the Alt-Right and
Identitarian Movement.\footnote{Although affinity for Japan by the Far
  Right is by no means a new phenomenon. In 2010 for example, a European
  delegation including previous French Front National leader Jean-Marie
  Le Pen and Belgian Vlaams Belang associate and European Parliament
  member Phillip Claeys, visited the politically controversial Yasukuni
  Shrine reportedly on invitation by the far-right movement (\emph{Uyoku
  Dantai}) \emph{issuikai} 一水会 (K.C.
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-k.c._how_2010}{2010}; Phillips and McCurry
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-phillips_bnp_2010}{2010}).\label{issuikai}} To
name some examples, former Donald Trump strategist and Breitbart News
Network owner Steve Bannon participated as a speaker at the 2017
\emph{Japanese Conservative Political Action Conference} (J-CPAC) and
praised Prime Minister Shinzō Abe as being ``Trump before Trump.''
Alt-Right and Identitarian Movement key associates including white
supremacists Richard Spencer (who coined the term Alt-Right) and Jared
Taylor (who himself was born in Japan and speaks fluent Japanese) often
sing praise of Japan as an exemplary \emph{ethno-state}. Finally, other
such Alt-Right associates include Vice Magazine\footnote{Founded at the
  time with a focus on underground subcultures. McInnes left Vice Media
  in 2008, prior to its expansion into news-making.} co-founder and
Proud Boys founder Gavin McInnes (that latter a far-right male-only
organization driven by the white genocide conspiracy theory and
notorious for inciting violence). Gavin McInnes has since gone on to
write for the Canadian far-right Internet media-platform The Rebel
Media, and in 2018 participated in a reenactment of the 1960
assassination of Japanese Socialist Party (JSP) chairman Inejiro Asanuma
by ultra-nationalist Otoya Yamaguchi (Feuer and Winston
\protect\hyperlink{ref-feuer_founder_2018}{2018}). Journalist Audrea
Lim, in her \emph{The New York Times} editorial, even goes so far to
assert ``yellow fever'' (a sexual obsession with those of Asian descent)
as a common trait amongst the Alt-Right, stating that many public
figures in the movement have had documented relationships with Asian
women (\protect\hyperlink{ref-lim_opinion_2018}{2018}).\footnote{It
  should be noted that a short news-report on YouTube covering this
  topic, ``A Lot Of White Supremacists Seem To Have An Asian Fetish
  (HBO)'' by VICE News
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-vice_news_lot_2017}{2017}), had as of writing
  a ratio of 6,1K dislikes to 5,6K likes. The comment section included
  comments such as ``absolute state of (((modern journalism))) \ldots{}
  the truth is people longing culture about sincerity, chivalry, family
  value, etc. the west is beyond saved from the sinner, hedonist, liar,
  and degenerate.'' `ShadyxFiascoX 32' wrote ``Personally Hitler loved
  Japan and said they had a good culture. What the hell is (((Vice)))
  talking about.'', which was liked 166 times. In both cases the triple
  parentheses (originated from Alt-Right discourse) imply Jewish
  ownership of the video's owner, Vice News. One comment, by ``Ochiai's
  Channel'' misinterprets this video's content by writing ``I am
  Japanese, and can I consider his talk as a hate speech against us?!''
  His channel, with a follower count of 610 subscribers and viewed over
  87K times as of writing, lists ``You can paste my videos anywhere, or
  you can even download it and edit to use it. \ldots{} However, if
  you're anti-Japan or pro-migration, you're not welcome to do any of
  those in any means'' (Ochiai's Channel
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-noauthor_ochiais_nodate}{2019}).}

This soft power influence is observable on a grass-roots level as well.
Charity (\protect\hyperlink{ref-charity_why_2016}{2016}), for example,
reports on the increasingly common phenomenon of encountering online
imagery containing politically-tinted Japanese animation characters
(wearing political symbols ranging from neo-Nazi symbols to
Trump-related iconography such as \emph{Make American Great Again}
hats). The fully English anonymous messaging board \emph{4chan} in
particular\footnote{4chan has been accredited with popularizing many
  aspects now common to Internet communities. Of note is the
  self-assessed demography of its users, consisting of a a mostly
  millennial, male user-base from the United States and Western Europe,
  listing interests as ``Japanese culture, anime, manga, video games and
  comics'' (Advertise - 4chan
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-noauthor_advertise_nodate}{2019}; Ellis
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-ellis_4chan_2018}{2018}).} (since September
2015 officially owned by 2channel founder Hiroyuki Nishimura) started in
2003 as a North-American copy of its Japanese equivalents text-board
2channel and image-board \emph{Futaba Channel} with an intended focus on
discussing Japanese pop-culture (Orsini
\protect\hyperlink{ref-orsini_how_2015}{2015}), but came under heavy
scrutiny in 2014 for its association with the \emph{Gamergate}
controversy and the Alt-Right. The former, a co-ordinated harassment
campaign against women targeting sexism in video game culture and the
multi-billion video game industry, can be interpreted both as protest
against diversification of a supposed gamer identity (a cultural
identity that has traditionally been associated with men) and as part of
a larger reactionary online \emph{culture war} over conservative and
progressive ideologies. The controversy has had widespread coverage,
including condemnation by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and
was extensively covered by Alt-Right key-figure Milo Yiannopoulos on the
far-right website Breitbart News Network. The outcome of this campaign
has been claimed to have had radicalizing effects amongst its supporters
(Wofford \protect\hyperlink{ref-wofford_is_2014}{2014}; Johnston
\protect\hyperlink{ref-johnston_chat_2014}{2014}; Morgan
\protect\hyperlink{ref-morgan_analysis_2016}{2016}; Martens
\protect\hyperlink{ref-martens_rally_2017}{2017}). Moreover, preliminary
research on such microcosmic English language Internet communities (such
as the political discussion section of 4chan, 4chan spin-off
\emph{8chan} and the conservative political section of \emph{Reddit})
observes strong neo-nationalist rhetoric exemplary of the Alt-Right.

8chan in particular has been described as a more radical spin-off of
4chan and in the wake of the New Zealand terror attack has been
associated with several other white-nationalist attacks.\footnote{An
  anonymous post on this message-board linked to a live-stream of the
  New Zealand terror attack, suggesting that the perpetrator was active
  on 8chan (Brewster \protect\hyperlink{ref-brewster_after_2019}{2019}).
  Prior to the 2019 Poway synagogue terror attack, a user on 8chan
  signed their post with the name of the alleged shooter, and in a
  similar fashion to the Christchurch perpetrator, posted a manifesto
  referencing the white genocide conspiracy theory and Internet
  subculture elements (Collins and Blankstein
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-collins_anti-semitic_2019}{2019}; Stewart
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-stewart_8chan_2019}{2019}). This reportedly
  happened again in August, 2019 prior to the El Paso, Texas shooting
  (Beckett and Levin \protect\hyperlink{ref-beckett_paso_2019}{2019}).}
Furthermore, on July 26, 2019 a \emph{New York Times} article on this
Reddit sub-community, \emph{The\_Donald}, reports that after repeated
incitement of violence aimed increasingly at police officers and public
officials, the forum has now been `quarantined'. This means that its
content is no longer algorithmically featured on the front-page of the
platform, that users have to log-in and specifically agree to enter this
sub-community, and that no revenue will be generated through
advertisements (Chokshi and Vigdor
\protect\hyperlink{ref-chokshi_reddit_2019}{2019}). Reportedly, both
Donald Trump's 2016 campaign manager and social media manager visit
The\_Donald on a daily basis (Parscale
\protect\hyperlink{ref-parscale_reddit_2016}{2016}; Restuccia, Lippman,
and Johnson \protect\hyperlink{ref-restuccia_get_2019}{2019}) and Donald
Trump himself was reported to give a Q\&A in the community as well
(Robertson \protect\hyperlink{ref-robertson_donald_2016}{2016}). This
research further argues those Internet communities to be hubs for
influencing mainstream political discourse and setting ``the narrative
agenda for mainstream media outlets'' (Hine et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-hine_kek_2016}{2016}; Pearson
\protect\hyperlink{ref-pearson_scientists_2016}{2016}; Zannettou et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-zannettou_web_2017}{2017}; Zannettou et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-zannettou_origins_2018}{2018}). Alt-right
appropriated \emph{viral} imagery (in colloquial terms known as
`memes')\footnote{Davison
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-davison_language_2012}{2012}) defines this as
  ``a piece of culture, typically a joke, which gains influence through
  online transmission.''} such as that of a green anthropomorphic frog
(`Pepe the Frog') find their roots in those communities as well, and
have been shared in some form by members of the current White House,
including Donald Trump and Donald Trump Jr. (Lee
\protect\hyperlink{ref-lee_understanding_2016}{2016}; Ohlheiser
\protect\hyperlink{ref-ohlheiser_analysis_2016}{2016}; Phillips
\protect\hyperlink{ref-phillips_alt-right_2016}{2016}).

Thus, to reiterate, an increase of mainstream news reports, as mentioned
above, claim occidental online communities with an origin in discussing
Japanese pop-culture are effectively 1. hotbeds for right-wing
radicalization, and 2. not unimportant electoral spaces for both
right-wing populist political parties attacking established institutions
and for politically motivated citizen movements in the United States and
Europe. Members of those movements have praised Japan as the ideal of an
`ethno-state', and have themselves gained political traction outside the
realm of the digital. Moreover, this chapter discussed this to be part
of a global trend of neo-nationalist discourse on the Internet and
claimed that terms as \emph{fachosphere}, Netto-Uyoku and Alt-Right are
conceived of as expressions of such phenomena. Nevertheless the
\emph{fachosphere}, for example, refers uniquely to the French
cyberspace in which such a discourse finds place (with the additional
connotation of fascist ideology), while the Alt-Right, now as a term
unquestionably grown beyond its intended use, was originally conceived
of as a particular ideological citizens movement in the United States.

As demonstrated in the next chapter, a common factor in literature on
the Netto-Uyoku is the connection with ideologically driven ACM
movements like the Zaitokukai (arguably the actual counterpoint to the
original Alt-Right). The term Netto-Uyoku (`net-right') however, while
vague in its usage of `right-wing', leans in its literal meaning more
closely to this phenomenon of Internet-driven right-wing populist
nationalism (i.e.~neo-nationalism), a phenomenon this paper would like
to further conceptualize as the ideological movement of
\emph{cyber-nationalism} (i.e.~a form of neo-nationalism formed by the
peculiarities of the Internet as a medium). Although overlapping with
recent conceptualizations of neo-nationalism, the \emph{neo} aspect does
not permit enough agency to the Internet as a medium and its underlying
logic. After all, ``the medium is the message'' as McLuhan famously
describes, and with roots in libertarian counter-culture movements, so
too are the Internet and World Wide Web ideologically driven (Markoff
\protect\hyperlink{ref-markoff_what_2005}{2005}; Rolfe
\protect\hyperlink{ref-rolfe_reinvention_2016}{2016}).

This chapter has also argued that the space of the Internet is
increasingly politicized and fertile soil for both grass-roots levels of
Internet activism and for large-scale political warfare. Within the context
of Internet and politics, academics have to various degrees hypothesized
on the contribution of the Internet to political polarization, on the
Internet's utilization by political actors applying populist strategies,
and on the media effects of so-called `new media' on its users regarding
political awareness and opinion-forming. Law professor Cass Sunstein
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-sunstein_republic:_2017}{2017}), for example,
theorizes about group polarization (consensus within an in-group that
moves towards further extremes in opposition to the out-group's
opinions) on online social media, as well as on the impact to democracy
of so-called online echo chambers and the phenomenon of the `Daily
Me'---reinforcement of one's own ideas through repeated confrontation with
opinions and news aligning with those ideas (Sunstein
\protect\hyperlink{ref-sunstein_republic:_2017}{2017}, ch.3). Although
deliberate misinformation (`fake news') is by no means a new trend
either,\footnote{Soll (\protect\hyperlink{ref-soll_long_2016}{2016})
  traces fake news in the west back to the invention of print media five
  centuries ago, to Gutenberg's invention of the printing press in 1439.
  In his essay, he recalls for example an account in 1475 of deliberate
  use of misinformation to persecute a Jewish community in Trent, Italy.}
this too has thrived due to the Internet's widespread usage. The lack of
moderation and the spontaneity of social network platforms facilitate (whether or not conscious) spreading and sharing of false information (or
information seen loose of its context), without reflection or without
source control, which has potentially far-reaching political consequences.

Our first hypothesis thus far is that those described as Netto-Uyoku are
ideologically similar to the Alt-Right and other such loosely connected
movements occurring on the Internet. But if we are to read the
Netto-Uyoku as a localized embodiment of such a global phenomenon of
counter-establishment neo-nationalism occurring on cyberspace, why then
are the Netto-Uyoku perceived of as being supportive of the LDP and Abe
Shinzō (a politician that is by all means of the word part of the
political establishment)? For that, we hypothesize the following:
whereas political newcomers and anti-establishment political actors have on a global
scale capitalized on the distrust of established institutions
experienced by these cyber-nationalists, the LDP has effectively done
this earlier in the wake of the 2011 earthquake and waning popularity of
the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), by appealing to Netto-Uyoku
sentiment while simultaneously deterring from the anti-establishment
elements of populist ideologies.

Based on this premise, several other questions come to mind:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  How then should we define Netto-Uyoku and cyber-nationalist ideology?
\item
  Are there similar trends of \emph{online culture wars} on Japanese
  social media?\footnote{Referring to the ongoing clash between
    reactionary and progressive ideologies, whereof the aforementioned
    Gamergate controversy is one such example.}
\item
  What processes do Netto-Uyoku employ to disseminate ideology?
\item
  Following McLuhan, how then do the media platforms the Netto-Uyoku
  utilize operate technically?
\item
  How does the movement organize and mobilize, both online and in real
  life?
\item
  Is there possible space for furthering a Netto-Uyoku political agenda
  through influencing its international counterparts?
\end{itemize}

This paper consists of four chapters, including this introductory first
chapter wherein we tried to draw the Netto-Uyoku in a wider, global
context and not regard it as a uniquely Japanese \emph{Galápagos
syndrome} phenomenon—although its idiosyncrasies are in no doubt shaped
by Japanese occurrences, as seen in the framing of Azuma
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-azuma_otaku:_2001}{2001}) and Kitada
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-kitada_eng:_2005}{2005}). To substantiate the above
hypotheses and answer those subquestions, the second chapter intents to
build a narrative on the Netto-Uyoku through a literature review of both
seminal and newer writings. As a relatively young and volatile term,
`Netto-Uyoku' has gone through several shifts in meaning, with earlier
reporting viewing the Netto-Uyoku not as an actual group with group
awareness, but loosely as people utilizing the Internet and engaging in
aggressive, politically-driven rhetoric online (Sasaki
\protect\hyperlink{ref-sasaki_netto-uyoku_2005}{2005}). Overal we find
three trends in the literature: 1. the analysis of discursive processes
of Netto-Uyoku rhetoric on social media such as Twitter and 2channel {(}Tsuji
\protect\hyperlink{ref-tsuji_eng:_2008}{2008}; Tsuji \protect\hyperlink{ref-tsuji_eng._2017}{2017};
Taka \protect\hyperlink{ref-taka_twitter_2015}{2015}\protect\hyperlink{ref-taka_twitter_2015}{a};
Taka\protect\hyperlink{ref-taka_twitter_2015-1}{2015}\protect\hyperlink{ref-taka_twitter_2015-1}{b};{)} 2. Netto-Uyoku and
their relation towards nationalist movements such as the Zaitokukai
(Yamaguchi \protect\hyperlink{ref-yamaguchi_xenophobia_2013}{2013};
Morris-Suzuki \protect\hyperlink{ref-morris-suzuki_freedom_2013}{2013};
Gill \protect\hyperlink{ref-gill_nativist_2018}{2018}) and 3. a
theoretical approach towards the rise of right-wing radicalization on
the Japanese Internet (Azuma
\protect\hyperlink{ref-azuma_otaku:_2001}{2001}; Kitada
\protect\hyperlink{ref-kitada_eng:_2005}{2005}; Sakamoto
\protect\hyperlink{ref-sakamoto_koreans_2011}{2011}). This paper then
too intents to read the Netto-Uyoku not as a noisy fringe element of
Japanese society, but as an ideologically driven movement with political
agency, and keeping in mind the context laid out in this chapter, the
power to exert influence on public discourse. While refraining from
taking too hard a technological determined position towards the Internet
(the implication being that the existence of the Internet as a medium
would by itself be a leading cause for societal change),\footnote{``Determinism
  is a philosophical system that posits every physical event, including
  human cognition and action, is causally determined by an unbroken
  chain of past occurrences and therefore makes it possible for us to
  know future effects with certainty. Technological determinism claims
  that technology is an autonomous,''self-controlling, self-determining,
  self-generating, self-propelling, self-propelling, selfperpetuating
  and self-expanding force \ldots{} out of human control, changing under
  its own momentum and `blindly' shaping society" (Chandler
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-chandler_act_1995}{1995}, 1).} and instead
treats the Netto-Uyoku in part as a symptom of deeper cultural malaise,
this paper does suggest that by no means should the Internet be
dismissed as merely a tool of communication either.

The third chapter lays down a Frankfurt School inspired lens of theory
through which this paper reads the Netto-Uyoku, based on this author's
understanding of ideology, populism and neo-nationalism. This is done
through the reasoning of thinkers associated with the Western Marxist
tradition or Frankfurt School of critical theory: Antonio Gramsci,
Theodor W. Adorno, and Jürgen Habermas---juxtaposing this with concrete
historical applications leading up to the present state in which the
Netto-Uyoku arises. In contextualizing populism, this chapter follow
Mudde (\protect\hyperlink{ref-mudde_oxford_2013}{2013}) in their
definitions of populism as a \emph{thin-centered} ideology antagonizing
a homogeneous elite in contrast to \emph{the People's Will}, a
homogeneous group of \emph{ordinary people}, utilizing an \emph{us
versus them} dichotomy.

The fourth chapter attempt to further lay bare underlying ideological
structures by conducting a mixed method content analysis of what is to
be understood as Netto-Uyoku rhetoric. This chapter focuses particularly
on two overlooked media-platforms in dispersing Netto-Uyoku thought:
Wikipedia and 2channel aggregation sites. This chapter then pays
particular attention to the \emph{modus operandi} of each platform as
well as the peculiarities of the Internet itself. Support for Japanese
characters on Internet addresses (URLs) is, for example, relatively new,
and thus are Japanese website URLs and many profile names on social made
dominantly written in the Latin alphabet (in the process hinting at a
technologically-determined hegemonic nature of the medium of the World
Wide Web itself). Finally, this chapter expands on one particular event
in recent Netto-Uyoku history: The `Netto-Uyoku Ban Matsuri'
(\emph{neto-uyo ban matsuri} ネトウヨBAN祭り). Earlier this chapter
inquired on the existence of a Japanese equivalent of online culture
wars. While setting up the outline of this paper, this question answered
itself. The latter uses methods of mass-reporting on YouTube and Twitter
for automatic removal of Netto-Uyoku related accounts.

On a closing note, it should be mentioned that any research involving
the Internet and social networks online is bound to have some risks and
limitations. In this case risks and limitations involve liquidity of
data, copyright laws pertaining to acquiring data and lack of
reliability due anonymity masking intent of the user.\footnote{Particularly
  on 4chan and 2channel are ambiguity and cynicism inherent elements of its
  discourse, increasing the difficulty of a critical reading. A
  blatantly offense message could be masked as irony either as defense
  for actual offensive intent, or as a deadpan form of inter-textual
  parody. This phenomenon is referred to as \emph{Poe's Law}.} As
referred to earlier, one issue that arose during the writing process was
the effect of an on-going online \emph{culture war} between Netto-Uyoku
members and anti-hate speech movements. This author concurs that
limiting public access to ideological extremist material reduces chances
of radicalization,\footnote{Widespread social media platforms as
  YouTube, Facebook and Twitter are already making efforts to remove
  contents that is deemed hateful or contains ``bigoted ideologies.''
  Donald Trump has criticized this move as being biased against
  conservative users (Stack
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-stack_trump_2019}{2019}; Roose and Conger
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-roose_youtube_2019}{2019}).} but for the
purposes of research it drastically impacted the ability to assess
network influence and trickle-down effects of extremist rhetoric on
mainstream platforms. Other issues are the extraction of online data
from an ethical viewpoint and the concept of informed consent, more so
in light of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The dataset contains data
created independent of the researcher on platforms that are explicitly
open (2channel, \emph{matome}-blogs and Wiki-style encyclopedias). In
other words, data that is openly available to group-outsiders and
explicitly intended to be so (including user-names) on online spaces
that are not expected to be private spaces. It is therefore reasonable
to argue that obtaining informed consent is not applicable in this case.

direct quotes from secondary literature).

\chapter{The Netto-Uyoku --- A Literature
Review}\label{the-netto-uyoku-a-literature-review}

To demonstrate the extent of reach the term Netto-Uyoku in its various
forms has had, the previous chapter touched upon a late 2010 print
article in \emph{The New York Times}. The first English language mention
in mainstream press, however, dates back to March 14, 2006, when
journalist Eric Johnston (\protect\hyperlink{ref-johnston_net_2006}{2006}) published a \emph{The Japan Times} piece on
right-wing nationalism and the Internet in Japan, ``Net boards venue for
faceless rightists.'' In his article, Johnston associates these
`faceless rightists' (who he further refers to as \emph{Net Uyoku}) with
hate-speech towards Koreans\footnote{When this paper refers to
  `Koreans', this broadly covers those with an ethnic background to the
  Korean peninsula. While the exact content of such messages differs
  depending on the recipient's background, this includes South-Korea,
  North-Korea and various diaspora in Japan with such ethnic backgrounds.} and
the anonymous messaging board 2channel. Moreover, Johnston ties them to
the conservative online video channel Channel Sakura and the revisionist
political organization \emph{Nippon Kaigi} (the latter which has deeply
rooted ties to the current iteration of the LDP),\footnote{Although the
  former too has been capitalized upon in timely fashion. See, for
  example, a June 11, 2009 Channel Sakura interview with Abe Shinzō
  ``The problems facing Japan and Mass media from hereonforth''
  (\emph{`Korekara no Nihon to masumedia mondai'}
  「これからの日本とマスメディア問題」) posted on its Youtube channel
  SakuraSoTV, criticizing biases in mainstream press such as the NHK and
  \emph{Asahi Shinbun}. Ten years after its initial upload, this video
  still draws comments. The user 匿名希望 (\emph{tokumei kibō}, `desire
  to stay anonymous'), for example, posts (translation provided by this paper) ``the
  NHK, which sends criminals (NHK contractors) to the Japanese people to
  rob them of money, is an enemy of Japan and an enemy of the Japanese.
  Dismantle the NHK! Abe, I'm supporting you! (*\^{}ー\^{})ノ♪''
  (SakuraSoTV \protect\hyperlink{ref-sakurasotv_eng._2009}{2009}).}
arguing ideological overlap. In Japan then, the term first reached print
press in a 2005 \emph{Mainichi shinbun} article by journalist and cultural critic Sasaki Toshinao (\protect\hyperlink{ref-sasaki_netto-uyoku_2005}{2005}), who described
the Netto-Uyoku as a `new conservative public opinion' (\emph{shin
hoshu-tekina yoron}, 新保守的な世論) that was able to sprout precisely
due to Internet as a medium.

If we look at an estimate of relative online interest in the topic of
Netto-Uyoku itself, using Google search queries from the past fifteen
years (see \textbf{figure \ref{fig:nettouyoku}}),\footnote{Google search
  queries offer a glimpse on public awareness and interest in a topic.
  This graph contrasts the term `Netto-Uyoku' as a `topic' (which
  includes algorithmically collected related keywords) and its breakdown
  in the literal search terms `\emph{netto-uyoku}' 「ネット右」 and
  `\emph{neto-uyo}' 「ネトウヨ」. Interest is scaled to the highest peak
  of interest (100), which is calculated based on the highest amount of
  queries for a term or topic, relative to the total Google search
  queries at that time; it is not an indicator of quantity. For more
  information on the methodology behind Google Trends, as well as other
  related graphs, see \textbf{\ref{appendix:googletrends}}. A comparison
  of this graph to similar data such as comparative trends in populism
  (\textbf{figure \ref{fig:populismtrends}}) and left/right-wing
  politics (\textbf{figure \ref{fig:politictrends}}) might offer some
  big-data insights in political interest by Japanese Internet users.}
we could assert that while there was a small rise in public interest
around the time of Sasaki's article, a national awareness of this
phenomenon did not appear until the late 2000s, when the LDP suffers a
landmark defeat and the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) replaced then
Prime Minister of Japan Asō Tarō with Hatoyama Yukio. It is around this
period too that academic interest in the Netto-Uyoku started to
increase. Peaks in this graph generally coincide with sudden bursts of
(geo-)political tensions. This includes election lead-ups (such as the
party election following former Prime Minister Naoto Kan's resignation
and the December 2012 general election), but also for example
large-scale Chinese protests in 2005 regarding talks of new Japanese
history textbooks downplaying war crimes (Kahn
\protect\hyperlink{ref-kahn_riot_2005}{2005}), and again in 2012 after
territorial disputes were reignited. Finally, this graph further shows
that the more pejorative `\emph{neto-uyo}' (「ネトウヨ」) overtakes the
more neutral `\emph{netto-uyoku}' 「ネット右翼」 in usage from mid-2009
onwards.

\section{Who are the Netto-Uyoku?}\label{who-are-the-netto-uyoku}

In one of the earlier English language publications by those in
academia, Morris-Suzuki\footnote{Tessa Morris-Suzuki is professor of
  Japanese History and frequent contributor to \emph{The Asia-Pacific
  Journal: Japan Focus}. Her academic work focuses primarily on the
  topic of identity and politics in Japan.}
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-morris-suzuki_freedom_2013}{2013}) warns against
the dangers of social media as a tool for populist mobilization, and
paradoxical usage of the empty signifier `freedom of speech'. While not
explicitly using the term Netto-Uyoku or \emph{net-right}, she describes
trends of ``violently xenophobic or racist messages, recycling wartime
language and imagery that had long disappeared from public discourse in
Japan'' on the anonymous Internet forum 2channel as a trend of
``Internet nationalism''. Based on a 2012 social media white paper
showcasing 2channel users to be predominantly young men, she frames this
group as ``lonely, frustrated \emph{otaku} (an isolated person with
obsessive interests), probably unemployed or in a dead-end job, seeking
some sense of identity by sharing anger and bitterness with nameless
others.'' She further hints that as the social media-scape shifts, so
too does this 2channel-inspired Netto-Uyoku discourse finds its way to
other platforms. The image of lonely Netto-Uyoku as \emph{otaku} seeking
comfort in nationalism and group-bonding online is indeed a compelling
narrative, if potentially stereotypical and, through such usage of
polemic language, at risk of drawing backlash. So how then have other
authors addressed this?

Several years earlier Tsuji
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-tsuji_eng:_2008}{2008}) made a first attempt at
drawing a quantitative view of the Netto-Uyoku demographic. By holding
an online survey (with a total of 998 valid participants), Tsuji tried
to map right-wing radicalization and polarization (based on Sunstein's
notion of \emph{group polarization}) amongst Internet-users, and used
the following traits to identify Netto-Uyoku:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Feelings of antagonism towards China and the Korea peninsula
\item
  Agreement with the Prime Minister's visits to the Yasukuni
  Shrine\footnote{A Shinto shrine generally commemorating those fallen
    in the service of the Japanese nation from the Meiji period onwards.
    This includes soldiers convicted of war crimes, including Class A
    war criminals during the Second World War. Public visits by
    politicians representing the state have drawn international criticism for
    unapologetic, nationalist behavior.}
\item
  Agreement with the revision of Article 9 of the constitution\footnote{Article
    9 respectively renounces war (clause 1) and deters any legal rights
    to maintain a national army (clause 2).}
\item
  Agreeing with the display of the national flag and singing the
  national anthem in elementary and middle schools
\item
  Having written on social or political issues on one's website, or
  commented and engaged in discussion on social media online
\end{enumerate}

Out of his sample, thirteen people have had strong agreements to all of
the above (1.3 percent) and, when eased to agreement of three items
including the fifth point, this number increased to thirty-one (3.1
percent). Tsuji concluded that based on these early findings, this group
indeed appears to be dominantly male, participates on
2channel, and has a negative bias towards mass communication. Moreover,
through a multiple regression analysis he concludes that a higher
frequency in usage of 2channel correlates with stronger feelings of
patriotism and exclusivism. Although some concerns could be raised on
the amount of Netto-Uyoku willing to truthfully participate in a
``survey on social awareness'',\footnote{Which is the title of the
  actual survey, \emph{shakai ishiki ni kansuru chōsa}
  「社会意識に関する調査」.} not to mention that the survey itself was
targeting only users between the ages of 20 and 44, this does indeed
suggest tendencies of right-wing polarization on 2channel. He further
expanded upon this research with a 2017 paper, after having again
revisited the survey in 2014 (Tsuji \protect\hyperlink{ref-tsuji_eng._2017}{2017}). As seen in \textbf{table \ref{tab:tsuji}},
Tsuji broadened his target audience, this time with a reach of 2,347
participants aged 20 to 59. For the sake of valid comparison, results
limited to the age-groups 20 - 44 in 2014 have been added in brackets.

\end{table}

While Tsuji's conclusions are not drastically different, finding no
significant discrepancies in academic background or income, he confirms
seven years after the initial study that this group of `Netto-Uyoku'
still prefer anonymous communication tools such as 2channel and video
service Niconico over social media such as Facebook or the messaging
service LINE. He further suggests that while there is not much of an
increase in users actively attempting to disseminate their political
opinions (an estimated two percent of Internet users), there is at least
an increase in latent Netto-Uyoku behavior when taking into
consideration the increase in reactionary and xenophobic
sentiment\footnote{In particular the idea that a rise of migrant foreigners will
  correlate to higher crime rates.} between 2008 and 2014.\footnote{He too argues
  the neo-nationalist ACM demonstrations as a real-life extension of the
  Netto-Uyoku and further refers to them as \emph{Nihon-ban no orutana
  uyoku} 日本版のオルタナ右翼, the Japanese version of the Alt-Right
  (Tsuji \protect\hyperlink{ref-tsuji_eng._2017}{2017}).} We find
however one additional trait missing, and one arguably inherent to such above-mentioned platforms as 2channel: a high distrust in mainstream media (in
particular towards the \emph{Asahi shinbun} and the NHK).

\section{Imagined Cyber-villages}\label{imagined-cyber-villages}

2channel, an anonymous message-board developed by Hiroyuki Nishimura (an
exchange student in the United States at the time), was described in an
earlier Wired article as the biggest bulletin board system in the
world---with 2.5 million posts a day (Katayama
\protect\hyperlink{ref-katayama_2-channel_2007}{2007}). The article
paraphrases Keio University lecturer Daisuke Okabe as saying that 2channel is for its users a
place ``where people can combat the mass media on a grass-roots level,''
bringing to mind imagery of warfare and suggesting a subconscious
reasoning of the Internet as ideologically different from mass-media.
Moreover, Katayama quotes 2channel founder Nishimura in reaction to
``more than 50 civil lawsuits in Tokyo alone and more than \$4 million
in settlements and court penalties for libel, defamation, copyright
violations, privacy and personal injury,'' as saying that he does not
have ``any intention of paying up to a country whose laws I don't
respect.'' This again implies an atmosphere of rebelliousness and one
that we could also associate with the messaging board itself.\footnote{In another intersection with its English language
  counterpart, it must be noted however that Hiroyuki Nishimura has
  since lost legal ownership of 2channel to the current owner of the
  extreme right-wing 4chan spin-off \emph{8chan}, Jim Watkins (Silverman
  and Lytvynenko \protect\hyperlink{ref-silverman_meet_2017}{2017}), and
  in turn himself became owner of 4chan. Furthermore, since Jim Watkins'
  take-over, 2channel now links to 8chan on its front-page. He has since
  gone on to create an intended 2channel rival \emph{2ch.sc}, which has
  attracted some of 2channel's former `population'.}

Kitada Akihiro (\protect\hyperlink{ref-kitada_eng:_2005}{2005}) argues that this
sense of rebelliousness and scorn towards mainstream media experienced
on 2channel---in other words, a social space of `cynical anti-media
culture'---lies at least in part at the roots of the nationalism
experienced on 2channel. Writing in 2005 about trends of a
`right-leaning tilt amongst youth' (\emph{Wakamono-tachi no ukei-ka},
若者たちの右傾化) shortly before the public adoption of the term
Netto-Uyoku, Kitada observes on 2channel a distinct cynical mode of
communication that relies on harsh bluntness, but one through which its
users develop a sense of intimacy. This mode of communication relies on
a constant source for critique through which it can sustain social
connections. As Kitada himself states in an English translation of his
2005 essay, ``From a sociological point of view, {[}2channel{]} marks a
departure from an instrumental rationality that supports the existing
social order. Instead, it is a social space that produces an extreme
form of connective rationality that supports ongoing communicative
actions and reactions that maintain the community.'' Furthermore, ``what
began as principled attacks on discrepancies between mass media's
ideology and reality have changed into an activity seeking to perpetuate
ironic communication, leading to a paranoid attitude that aggressively
seeks discrepancies between form and content'' (Itō, Okabe, and Tsuji
\protect\hyperlink{ref-ito_fandom_2012}{2012}, 70--80).\footnote{Kitada
  views this cynical anti-media culture as an extension of an '80s
  consumerist society in which sensibilities of playful irony associated
  with media literacy and intertextuality became vulgarized through
  interaction with popular media. That is to say, a population growing
  up with the medium of TV developed a sense of ironic distance to this
  media, and an insider culture associated with the new mode of
  communication through which youth sought interactivity adopted a
  cynical stance towards ``the discrepancies between mass media systems
  and journalism,'' (Itō, Okabe, and Tsuji
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-ito_fandom_2012}{2012}, 76).}

This channels to a certain extent political scientist Anderson's
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-anderson_imagined_2006}{2006}) notion of
\emph{imagined communities}, which Sakamoto
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-sakamoto_koreans_2011}{2011}), Murai
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-murai_net_2012}{2012}) and this author
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-poppe_digitaal_2017}{2017}) have relied upon in
an attempt to explain the sense of kinship shared by those whose
identities are clouded in the anonymity of the Internet. Anderson, in his
work on nationalism, draws attention to the transforming role of what he
called \emph{print-capitalism}, the capitalist drive behind
mass-printing in vernacular languages. His idea of nations as `imagined'
communities implies that the sense of kinship felt between its members
is a social construct based on imagined mutual experiences. These
imagined mutual experiences are facilitated by a standardization of
language stemming from this print capitalism, and the subsequent rise in
mass-media. Through such national media consumption, these communities
then develop a sense of imagined sameness as well as a clearly defined
paradigm of `otherness'. In that sense, the communities on 2channel (and
indeed, on its English counterparts) gain their imagined sense of
comradeship through Kitada's suggested grammar of cynicism---mutual
consumption and critique of national, mainstream media events, and the
cynical, harsh language driving such conversations. Deviate from such
rigid structures in those communities and one risks backlash or
ostracism.\footnote{A common tactic on these forums is to antagonize and
  mock the deviating party as someone belonging to the self-perceived
  enemies. On Japanese social media for example, the term `certified
  \emph{Zainichi}' (\emph{zainichi nintei}, 在日認定) is used to refer
  to baseless assumption of someone being ethnically Korean.}

This logic has also been covered by media scholar McLuhan and his work
in the 1967 \emph{The Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man},
expanding upon Harold Innis's \emph{The Bias Of Communication} (1951).
Innis wrote that, ``the effect of the discovery of printing was evident
in the savage religious wars of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.
Application of power to communication industries hastened the
consolidation of vernaculars, the rise of nationalism, revolution, and
new outbreaks of savagery in the twentieth century''
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-mcluhan_gutenberg_2011}{2011}, 245). McLuhan,
extending Innis, argued that the invention of print-media transformed an
oral, `time-biased' tribe culture into a literate `space-biased'
culture, changing our mental processes and bringing about a heightened
sense of individual consciousness yet laying the groundworks for
nationalism.\footnote{``The inherent conflict {[}\ldots{}{]} is at the
  centre of print technology itself, which isolates the individual yet
  also creates massive groupings by means of vernacular nationalism.''
  This inherent conflict refers to the conflict of the ``need for
  self-definition'' with the ``process of renunciation of differences''
  (McLuhan et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-mcluhan_gutenberg_2011}{2011},
  244).} With his idea of a `global village', McLuhan hypothesized then
that trends towards electronic media (referring at the time to radio and
television) would again alter society---from a literate culture to a
`post-literate' visual culture, one with different forms of social
interaction. That is to say, one of a collective, homogeneous identity,
in which the lack of a physical body or physical cues creates a
different relation to oneself and one's surroundings (McLuhan et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-mcluhan_gutenberg_2011}{2011}, 21--35).  Azuma (\protect\hyperlink{ref-azuma_ippan_2011}{2011}), Tamura and Kobayashi
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-tamura_niggling_2014}{2014}) argue similar to
McLuhan that the very nature of electronic media would shrink the
world into a `global village' or bring about a `General Will 2.0' and
cause social change through increased social and political involvement
and awareness. In this somewhat Utopian view would the Internet as medium then,
precisely because of the general lack of gate-keepers, and the dual role
of the Internet-user as both consumer and producer, serve as a fitting
example of McLuhan's `global village'.\footnote{It is fitting too
  then that former Vice President of the United States, Al Gore,
  referred to the Internet in a 1994 speech for the International
  Telecommunication Union, as `information superhighways' that would
  serve as a `metaphor of democracy' and lead to a `global community.'

\section{The Action-Conservative Movement
(ACM)}\label{the-action-conservative-movement-acm}

In another early academic work on the Netto-Uyoku, Sakamoto
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-sakamoto_koreans_2011}{2011}) connects the
Netto-Uyoku to 2channel and Niconico, and adheres to Tsuji's
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-tsuji_eng:_2008}{2008}) earlier classification
in describing the Netto-Uyoku as follows (Sakamoto
\protect\hyperlink{ref-sakamoto_koreans_2011}{2011}, 2--4):

\begin{quote}
Mirroring the post-1990s historical revisionism, netto-uyo exhibit
xenophobia towards immigrants, depict Korea and China negatively, and
uphold revisionist history, justifying and glorifying Japan's wartime
actions. They also support political leaders' official visits to
Yasukuni Shrine, revision of Article 9 of the constitution, and
patriotic education. {[}\ldots{}{]} Netto-uyo's `we the Japanese' does
not even include all ethnic Japanese, as those who do not share their
values (liberals, left-wingers, feminists, supporters of non-Japanese
residents' rights, Korean TV drama fans etc.) are all considered
potential enemies of the nation."
\end{quote}

Moreover, Sakamoto calls 2channel\footnote{She abbreviates 2channel as
  2-chan. This should however not be confused with another messaging
  board, Futaba Channel, which is often referred to as 2chan due its URL
  2chan.net.} ``\,`not for the faint of heart', this unmoderated forum
is known to be the main outlet for revisionism and xenophobic
neonationalism of the internet generation''
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-sakamoto_koreans_2011}{2011}, 2). Like Kitada,
she concurs that the nationalism occurring on 2channel is not an
extension of preexisting nationalism, saying that ``discourses that
develop on the Internet may exhibit different characteristics from those
that form outside the Internet,'' and further arguing that ``{[}a{]}s
one of the many strands of nationalism that constitute contemporary
Japan's neonationalist landscape {[}\ldots{}{]} {[}2channel{]} online
nationalism should not be dismissed as mere chatter,'' (Sakamoto
\protect\hyperlink{ref-sakamoto_koreans_2011}{2011}, 13). Instead, so
she continues, ``{[}a{]}lthough netto-uyo nationalism currently remains
largely within cyberspace, and although cynicism seems to prevail over
modernist commitment to a fixed meaning, the potential for its
politicisation and mobilisation exists''
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-sakamoto_koreans_2011}{2011}, 13).

Although through our paper we deals primarily with the potential for
\emph{politization} (and Sakamoto too argues that Netto-Uyoku are too
cynical to participate outside the realm of the digital), illustrations
of \emph{mobilization} are far from unheard of. In the light of an increased
Fuji Television programming of South Korean TV series, for example,
several counter-protests were held in August 2011 drawing an estimate
2,000 to 10,000 participants depending on the source (Schilling
\protect\hyperlink{ref-schilling_japanese_2011}{2011}; Chosun.com
\protect\hyperlink{ref-chosun.com_japanese_2011}{2011}; Ilbo
\protect\hyperlink{ref-the_donga_ilbo_japans_2011}{2011}; Itagaki
\protect\hyperlink{ref-itagaki_anatomy_2015}{2015}). Perhaps the most
clear testament to their potential for mobilization, though, lies
in the activities of what Yamaguchi
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-yamaguchi_xenophobia_2013}{2013}) translates as
ACM, the Action Conservative Movement (\emph{kōdō suru hoshu undō},
行動する保守運動). As referred to in the first chapter, those
neo-nationalist groups are linked to the Netto-Uyoku, and have held over
a thousand documented marches in the timespan of three years (Nikaido
\protect\hyperlink{ref-nikaido_eng:_2016}{2016}). Higuchi, author of the
2016 \emph{Japan's Ultra-Right}, compares these ACM groups with the rise
of neo-nationalism in Europe and argues that ``{[}w{]}hile Japan's old
radical right is authoritarian, anti-communist, and nationalist, the new
radical right is uniquely characterized by its xenophobia'' (Higuchi and
Castelvetere \protect\hyperlink{ref-higuchi_japans_2016}{2016}, 1).

We see this discrepancy between the neo-nationalism associated with the
Netto-Uyoku and ACM, and `traditional' nationalism, in the criticism by
what might be considered the `historical' (post-war) far-right movements
in Japan (\emph{uyoku dantai}, 右翼団体). According to Yasuda
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-yasuda_eng:_2012}{2012}), those groups claim
that the ACM are `not rooted in conservative or right-wing ideology'
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-yasuda_eng:_2012}{2012}, 320). The head of the
\emph{uyoku dantai} `Unification Front Volunteer Army' (\emph{tōitsu
sensen giyūgun}, 統一戦線義勇軍), for example, criticized the ACM group
Zaitokukai as not being able to distinguish between the Internet and
reality, acting rashly without experience
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-yasuda_eng:_2012}{2012}, 324--25). Furthermore,
amongst the representatives of an organization formed to counter the
xenophobia of ACM groups, \emph{Norikoe netto} (のりこえねっと, a
contraction of `\emph{Heitosupīchi to reishizumu o norikoeru kokusai
nettowāku}' 「ヘイトスピーチとレイシズムを乗り越える国際ネットワーク」,
lit. ``International network to overcome hate speech and racism''), we
find not just former Prime Minister of Japan Murayama Tomiichi, and
freelance journalist Yasuda, but also founder of the \emph{uyoku dantai}
`Issuikai'\footnote{The \emph{uyoku dantai} that in 2010 reportedly
  invited several high-standing European ultra-nationalists for a visit
  to the Yasukuni Shrine. See footnote \footnoteref{issuikai} on page
  \pageref{issuikai}.} Suzuki Kunio (Net
\protect\hyperlink{ref-net_norikoe_2015}{2015}).\footnote{This group's
  name is a deliberate reference to the aggressive demonstrations held
  by the Zaitokukai in regards to a Filipino schoolgirl, Noriko
  Calderon, whose parents were deported as illegal immigrants.}

The ACM's topics of choice, so then writes Meiji Gakuin University
Professor Tom Gill,\footnote{In his paper on the ACM, he describes
  2channel in a rather negative light as ``an internet site which is
  well known for no-holdsbarred discussion, virulent ad hominem attacks
  and rightist/racist rhetoric'' (Gill
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-gill_nativist_2018}{2018}, 184).} include ``the
lay Buddhist religious movement Soka Gakkai, the Japan Teacher's Union
(\emph{Nikkyōso}), the Buraku Liberation League (\emph{Buraku Kaihō
Dōmei}), the media {[}\ldots{}{]} and sometimes the national and local
governments. However, its most striking feature is its hostility to
foreigners in Japan generally, and Koreans in particular,''
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-gill_nativist_2018}{2018}, 176). To reiterate,
the antagonizing of (ethnic) minority groups, foreigners and the media.
While a complete overview of the ACM and a breakdown of their concrete
stances lies beyond the scope of this paper, it is of some essence to
cover the Zaitokukai and its founder Sakurai Makoto, the man who stirred
Fackler (\protect\hyperlink{ref-fackler_new_2010-1}{2010}) to write his
initial \emph{The New York Times} article. Founded in 2006, the
Zaitokukai gained notoriety for its frequent demonstrations throughout
Japan and its aggressive rhetoric mirroring the language used on
2channel. As we might defer from the group's full name, ``The Citizens'
Group Refusing to Tolerate Special Rights for Zainichi Koreans''
(\emph{Zainichi Tokken o Yurusanai Shimin no Kai}
在日特権を許さない市民の会), their activities are centered dominantly
around the topic of ethnic Koreans residing in Japan,\footnote{This
  paper for the sake of brevity refers to the different diaspora with
  ethnic roots in the Korean peninsula and immigration histories tracing
  back to Japan's rule of the peninsula as `ethnic Koreans' (in
  Japanese, usually preceded with the term \emph{zainichi} 在日,
  literally meaning `residing in Japan'). We do not infer that the
  identity felt amongst these groups is homogeneous, and the complexity
  of the pre-war Korean kingdom known as Chosŏn, the post-war North and
  South Korea, the ambiguous legal state of these groups `permanently
  residing' in Japan and the various difficulties of integration these
  impose goes beyond the scope of this paper. When this paper refers to
  xenophobia as an ideological element of Netto-Uyoku or ACM, this
  includes the logic of viewing those `ethnic Koreans' as non-Japanese
  and thus not belonging.} with protests often held in neighborhoods with
large concentrations of ethnic Koreans. Nevertheless, they often engage
in attacks on media due to a supposedly biased programming towards South
Korean pop-culture and `concealment' of the truth (e.g.~crimes
supposedly committed by those groups), and have engaged in reactionary
protests against left-wing counter-protests (on topics such as nuclear
energy).\footnote{See for example the ``Demonstration march for not
  extinguishing the fire of nuclear plants'' (\emph{genpatsu no hi o
  kesasenai demo kōshin} 「原発の火を消させないデモ行進」), a counter
  counter-protest in Shibuya on April 17, 2011, held in the belief that
  anti-Japanese left-wingers purposefully intend to weaken Japan from
  the inside by limiting its energy sources (Sakurai
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-sakurai__2011}{2011}).}

Yasuda, author of ``The Internet and Patriotism'' (``\emph{Netto to
Aikoku}'', 『ネットと愛国』) extensively covered the Zaitokukai;
conducting interviews with its members and supporters\footnote{In 2017,
  the Zaitokukai's main page claimed a membership of 16,399 people, of
  which 14,079 (85,85\%) were male (Poppe
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-poppe_digitaal_2017}{2017}, 24--25). As of
  writing, the Zaitokukai web-page referred to is no longer online.} as
well as those who have known the Zaitokukai's founder as a child. Yasuda
found that, in spite of rhetoric inciting violence (at times including
the actual usage of violence)\footnote{For which Sakurai and three other
  members of the Zaitokukai were arrested. This article too reached the
  print edition of \emph{The New York Times} courtesy of Martin Fackler
  (Fackler \protect\hyperlink{ref-fackler_japanese_2013}{2013}).} and
racial pejoratives, its members are generally speaking `normal'
citizens.\footnote{Although going to some extents to include the social
  or economic exclusion felt by those supporters.} Higuchi
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-higuchi_japans_2014}{2014}) drives this point
further, stating they are `normal' in the sense that based on his
surveys, they do not even stand out due to economic malaise or for being
on the fringes of society. Furthermore, a common trait of these groups
is, unlike the mostly male-dominated post-war nationalist groups
collectively known as \emph{uyoku dantai}, the inclusion of women; with
various ACM groups solely built around the female identity.\footnote{Gill
  sums several of these up, such as the ``\emph{Nippon Josei no Kai
  Soyokaze} (Japan Women's Association Breeze), its offshoot
  \emph{Aikoku Josei no Tsudoi Hanadokei} (Patriotic Women's Gathering
  Flower Clock), \emph{Zenkoku Hoshu Josei Rengō} (National Conservative
  Women's Alliance) and \emph{Nadeshiko Akushon} (Japanese Women for
  Justice and Peace)'' (Gill
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-gill_nativist_2018}{2018}, 176).} Yamaguchi
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-yamaguchi_xenophobia_2013}{2013}) argued earlier
that ACM groups such as the Zaitokukai pay strong attention to the
normative aspect of being `normal members of society'. This inclusive
role is then purposely done, to quote Yamaguchi, ``to enhance the
`ordinariness' of the ACM. Women are encouraged to deliver speeches,
walk in front of the group, and wear the kimono not only as the epitome
of Japanese women's tradition but for visual impact''
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-yamaguchi_xenophobia_2013}{2013}, 104).

Morris-Suzuki
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-morris-suzuki_freedom_2013}{2013}), like Yasuda,
Higachi and Yamaguchi, noted the Zaitokukai's active use of social media
for propagating ideology, hinting at a radicalizing effect by claiming
that such media usage is how the Zaitokukai ``recruit the young.''
Indeed, its core members are savvy Internet-users using Twitter,
Niconico and Youtube to spread videos of their protests,\footnote{In an
  interview with Yamaguchi, one of its members points out that the
  protests serve as vehicle to broadcast online (Yamaguchi
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-yamaguchi_xenophobia_2013}{2013}, 108).
  Niconico has since, under influence of the 2016 anti-discrimination
  law, removed the Zaitokukai's account (Tsunehira Furuya
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-furuya_can_2016}{2016}\protect\hyperlink{ref-furuya_can_2016}{b}).
  Youtube and Twitter have taken similar actions.} and this author
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-poppe_digitaal_2017}{2017}) further pointed out
the stylistic resemblance of the Zaitokukai's homepage to 2channel, as
well as the usage of \emph{otaku} subculture elements, such as cartoon
characters to drive their arguments.\footnote{Moreover in a
  mixed-methods content analysis of a corpus of approximately 3200
  Twitter messages (including retweets) of the Zaitokukai's founder,
  this author (\protect\hyperlink{ref-poppe_digitaal_2017}{2017}) noted
  the topics to be dominantly centered around antagonizing South Korea
  and left-wing politics (using the pejorative term \emph{payoku}
  パヨク, `leftists').} As Yamaguchi and Gill argue, they draw on a
social anxiety that began in the early 2000s with the public
acknowledgment of North Korean kidnappings of Japanese civilians, as
well as protests with anti-Japanese sentiment held throughout East-Asia
in 2005, and economic stagnation in the face of China and South Korea's
rapid growth. It is nevertheless not just an outsider group's
radicalizing usage of media, that is of note. Rather, it could be argued
that it is within this right-leaning cynical Internet discourse itself
that the Zaitokukai arose.\footnote{Writing ``the Internet too was a
  catalyst for encouraging Sakurai's activities'' (\emph{Netto wa
  Sakurai jishin no hiyaku o mo unagasu kikkake tomo natta},
  「ネットは桜井自身の飛躍をも促すきっかけともなった」), Yasuda suggests
  that it was within the discourse of the Internet that Zaitokukai
  founder Sakurai Makoto was able to rise (Yasuda
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-yasuda_eng:_2012}{2012}, 45).} Its founder,
going by the pen name Makoto Sakurai,\footnote{In the wake of the arrest
  of several Zaitokukai-members, News
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-nikkei_news__2013}{2013}) published an article
  revealing his birth name to be Takada Makoto (高田誠). Due to the wide
  spread usage of his pen name, this paper retains the usage of Sakurai
  Makoto.} started his `anti-Korean activities' (\emph{kenkan katsudō},
嫌韓活動) during the 2002 FIFA world championship jointly organized by
South Korea and Japan, claiming in an interview with the conservative
right-wing newspaper \emph{Sankei shinbun}
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-sankei_news__2016}{2016})\footnote{One of the
  few mainstream outlets covering his political ambitions during the
  2016 Tokyo gubernatorial elections.} that despite immense support from
Japan, Sakurai noted an anti-Japanese presence on the Internet, with
such slogans as ``Lose, Japan!'' (\emph{Nihon makero} 「日本負けろ」)
making its way onto anonymous messaging boards.

Before going on to start the Zaitokukai in 2006, run for Tokyo Governor
in 2016 and start a political party in 2017 (the Japan First Party,
\emph{Nippon daiichi tō} 日本第一党), much of this early period as a
self-proclaimed political activist (\emph{seiji katsudōka} 政治活動家)
happened online and in interaction with similar forms of neo-nationalism
occurring on the South Korean Internet.\footnote{Going in discussion
  with South Koreans on forums backed with automatic translation
  software (\emph{hon'yaku keijiban} 翻訳掲示板), including that of
  Korean Internet portal NAVER. Murai references the VANK (Voluntary
  Agency Network of Korea), who took part in cyber-attacks on 2channel
  and in turn spread similar aggressive rhetoric on the Internet. As
  Murai states, ``Ironically, such conflicts of radical nationalism have
  given credibility to Net Uyoku's radical ideology'' (Murai
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-murai_net_2012}{2012}, 374).} It is only
through his continuous online activities\footnote{Including one website
  ``The Strange Country, South Korea'' (fushigi no kuni no kankoku
  「不思議の国の韓国」, a pun on ``Alice in Wonderland'', \emph{fushigi
  no kuni no arisu} 『不思議の国のアリス』), a forum ``live discussions
  on Korea'' (\emph{kankoku nama tōron} 「韓国生討論」) and a blog under
  his longtime user-name \emph{Doronpa01}.} that Sakurai received an
initial invitation to star as guest member on the Nippon TV (日本テレビ)
variety-show `Generation Jungle' (\emph{jenejan}, 「ジェネジャン」),
became frequent contributor to the bi-monthly conservative magazine
Japanism (\emph{`japanizumu'}, 「ジャパニズム」)\footnote{Published by
  \emph{Seirindō}, the publishing house behind the influential
  underground manga anthology Garo (ガロ) and more recently, several
  other of Sakurai's writings, including the 2014 ``Great Korean Hate
  Era'' (``\emph{dai kenkan jidai}'', 『大嫌韓時代』 and the 2016
  ``Great Korean Hate Diary'' (``\emph{dai kenkan nikki}'',
  『大嫌韓日記』). The magazine, as well as the publishing house
  Seirindō, have gone through different editors-in-chief, with a gradual
  shift towards radical political topics.} and eventually in 2006
started the Zaitokukai.\footnote{In October 2014 Sakurai participated in
  a recorded debate with former mayor of Osaka, Hashimoto Tōru. This
  ended several minutes after both parties engaged in verbal insults
  (2021 summer \protect\hyperlink{ref-2021_summer_vs_2014}{2014}).
  Sakurai stepped down as Zaitokukai leader shortly after.} As we can
further defer from \textbf{figure \ref{fig:murai-ratio}}, that latter
magazine (which started its print in April 2011 shortly after the March
11 Earthquake) attempts to reach a younger audience by juxtaposing
elements of \emph{otaku} subculture with content that is highly
ideological.

\section{From 2channel \& Niconico}\label{from-2channel-niconico}

Moving away from views of neo-nationalism on the Internet decidedly as
an expression of social anxiety, however, Sakamoto
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-sakamoto_koreans_2011}{2011}) too shifts her
point of focus on the discursive practices of building identity and
nationalism online. For that, she conducts a content analysis of one
thread on 2channel, involving the discussion of a YouTube clip on
Tsushima Island,\footnote{An island located in between Japan and the
  Korean Peninsula. Due its location, it is one element in the
  territorial desputes (and the larger nationalist conflicts) between
  South Korea and Japan.} which gained 7000 reactions over a time span
of four days. According to her analysis, the majority of comments
deferred from the original topic at hand and serve simply to reinforce a
negative portrayal of Koreans as the cultural Other;\footnote{The
  `Other' in post-colonial theory signifies a classification based on
  perceived differences to exclude or marginalize, and differentiate
  between the in-group and out-group.} that is to say, an empty
signifier symbolizing that what is ``\,`inferior', `dirty', `shameless',
`primitive', `violent', and `irrational'\,'', which then in the process
implies the Japanese participants on these threads to be the opposite
(Sakamoto \protect\hyperlink{ref-sakamoto_koreans_2011}{2011}, 7).

\begin{quote}
\begin{quote}
``Collectively, the 7,000 postings produced and reinforced the negative
image of Korea and Koreans far beyond the Tsushima issue. Forum
participants brought up a multitude of Korea related issues which had
nothing to do with Korean tourists on Tsushima: the `special tax and
welfare privileges' that zainichi Koreans allegedly enjoy, the `illegal
occupation' of Takeshima Island', kimchi with parasite eggs, or crimes
by Koreans in Japan and overseas. Links were made to a TV news item
about a Japanese boy who was attacked in Korea, snapshots of
anti-Japanese artwork by Korean school children, a Youtube clip on a
rape by a zainichi Korean, {[}2channel{]} threads on zainichi pension
entitlement and welfare benefits, shocking images of anti-Japanese
demonstrators slaughtering pheasants (Japan's national bird) in front of
the Japanese Embassy, and many more. These and other unrelated events
and images are linked together under the unifying but empty sign of the
`Koreans','' (Sakamoto
\protect\hyperlink{ref-sakamoto_koreans_2011}{2011}, 5).
\end{quote}
\end{quote}

Sakamoto discusses the often decontextualized, historically revisionist
(or rather, ahistoric) usage of events and imagery in this thread in the
context of French sociologist Baudrillard's theorization of simulacra,
simulation, the hyper-real and the construction of reality. Although
this is but one interpretation of highly dense theory, simulation for
Baudrillard has in consumerist society come to no longer
\emph{represent} or \emph{copy} reality, but is through discursive
processes the \emph{realization} of that with no base in reality, ``a
real without origin or reality'' (Baudrillard
\protect\hyperlink{ref-baudrillard_simulacra_1994}{1994}, 1). For
Baudrillard, culture and media replace our understanding of an
`\emph{actual}' reality and meaning with simulations and simulacra; with
the \emph{idea} of reality. Sakamoto
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-sakamoto_koreans_2011}{2011}, 9) argues as
follows:

\begin{quote}
Baudrillard's point was that simulation proliferated as a result of the
new media like TV, but the Internet as a participatory medium carried
this trend even further. {[}2channel{]} users are not just passive consumers of
such signs provided by the mass media but are producing, performing, and
exchanging referentless, decontexualised signs to generate a sense of
belonging to a cyber community and a fantasy `Japan'.
\end{quote}

This notion of a \emph{fantasy} Japan both consumed and produced by
Netto-Uyoku is not unlike cultural critic Azuma Hiroki's
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-azuma_otaku:_2001}{2001}) critique of otaku,
``\emph{Dōbutsu-ka suru posutomodan --- otaku kara mita Nihon Shakai}''
(『動物化するポストモダン---オタクから見た日本社会』, \emph{Animalized
Postmodernity --- Japanese Society from the Viewpoint of Otaku}). Azuma
argues that although the imagery \emph{otaku} consume and produce stems
from an imitation of American pop-culture (in particular Disney
animation), attempts are made to draw connections to pre-war traditions
(in particular the Edo-period of 1603-1868) and portray this subculture
and the media they consume as uniquely Japanese. Moreover, traditional
Japanese motifs in wholly unrelated genres such as science fiction serve
to reinforce an imagined \emph{fantasy} or \emph{pseudo}-Japan
(\emph{giji Nihon}, 疑似日本). This pseudo-Japan, argues Azuma, stems from a psychological need for
self reinforcement due to the loss of traditional identity after the
Second World War, and again due to ongoing contradictions in society
reaching its peak after the narrative of economic growth collapsed in
the '90s (Azuma \protect\hyperlink{ref-azuma_otaku:_2001}{2001}, ch.1).
Moreover, Azuma puts right-wing ideologies in Japan in direct
correlation to this \emph{otaku} subculture, arguing that ``it can be
said that Japan's right-wing discourse has generally survived through
processes of becoming subcultured, falsified and \emph{otaku}-ized.''
(Azuma \protect\hyperlink{ref-azuma_otaku:_2001}{2001}, 23).\footnote{``\emph{Nihon
  no uyoku-teki gensetsu wa ippan ni sabukaruchā-ka shi feiku-ka shi
  otaku-ka suru koto de ikinokotte kitatomo ieru.}'',
  「日本の右翼的言説は一般にサブカルチャー化しフェイク化しオタク化することで生き残ってきたとも言える。」
  (Azuma \protect\hyperlink{ref-azuma_otaku:_2001}{2001}, 23).} That in itself
then fits into Harumi Befu's argument of the rise of \emph{Nihonjinron}
日本人論 literature as filling a `symbolic vacuum' created in the search
for cultural and national identity.\footnote{Broadly speaking,
  literature that argues the (cultural) uniqueness of Japan. For Befu,
  this constitutes literature that ``gives explicit explanation as to
  what national identity consists of and why one should be proud of
  one's nation'', and furthers the wartime ethno-nationalist ideology of
  ``the Japanese people being homogeneous and Japanese culture being
  pure and unique'', without being bound by tainted war-memories
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-befu_symbols_2002}{2002}, 42--44).} That, as
the result of ``the use of major symbols of national identity and pride
{[}being{]} rendered problematic by the Second World War''
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-befu_symbols_2002}{2002}, 26).

\end{figure}

One could then further read Baudrillard's notion of simulations and
simulacra in Azuma's argument, stating that those Japanese motifs in
Japanese sub-cultural media associated with \emph{otaku} are exactly
such examples of a \emph{real} without referent---a mediated
hyper-reality that precedes actual reality. Moreover, if there is one
online platform illustrating Azuma's and Sakamoto's interpretation of
Baudrillard, we could point to Niconico (\emph{nikoniko} ニコニコ).

Founded in 2006 as a video sharing service similar to YouTube and as of
July 2019 the tenth most visited website in Japan,\footnote{Based on
  Alexa ranking. For a full list of the top fifty most popular pages,
  see \textbf{table \ref{tab:50mostpopjp}}. Alexa statistics further
  reveal that half of 2channel's audience overlaps with that of Niconico
  (Alexa \protect\hyperlink{ref-alexa_alexa_2019}{2019}).} Niconico
caters (as illustrated in \textbf{figure \ref{fig:nicotop}}) primarily
to sub-cultural groups with a focus on Japanese animation or video-games
(or what has arguably since transcended to pop-culture status). While
functionally similar to what YouTube offers, Niconico distinguishes
itself through the ability to place time-synced, horizontally scrolling
comments on top of the video playing. Niconico is therefore not just
reliant on user generated content, the content is itself actively
transformed by those same users. While this brings about an imagined
sense of community as envisioned by Kitada, it could be argued that not
unlike a laugh track on prime-time sitcoms indicating comical beats,
such methods creates a standardized, homogeneous reaction to particular
beats in the video. In a 2013 \emph{Japan Times}, article journalist Mie
Ayako (\protect\hyperlink{ref-mie_xenophobia_2013}{2013}) paraphrases
DPJ's then-Secretary General Azumi Jun in criticizing Abe's proposal to
campaign on Nico Nico exactly because ``Net uyoku often alter such
videos by directly overlaying their comments on them.''\footnote{A 2013
  \emph{Tokyo shinbun} article claimed that Hirai Takuya, current
  minister in charge of information technology policy, minister of State
  for ``Cool Japan'' and accredited developer of the LDP-themed iPhone
  game `Abepyon' (あべぴょん), wrote jeering comments aimed at
  opposition leaders using this function while watching a live broadcast
  of a political debate on Niconico (Tokyo Shimbun
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-tokyo_shimbun_tokyo_2013}{2013}), which has
  since become a running joke.}

Niconico further contains a category with topics related to society,
politics and news, and is since used for broadcasting political
discussions and information on elections.\footnote{Take, for example,
  the July 4, 2019 political debate between Prime Minister Shinzō Abe
  and the opposition concerning the July 21, 2019 Upper House election,
  which was co-hosted by Dwango Co. and Yahoo Japan and broadcast
  through niconico live (The Asahi Shimbun
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-the_asahi_shimbun_constitutional_2019}{2019}).}
Its founding coincides with the start of tech-savvy ACM groups as
Zaitokukai, and its overlap with 2channel (Hiroyuki Nishimura himself
served as CEO for the company behind Niconico, Dwango) did indeed give
those groups a head-start in setting the political mood. Niconico has
since expanded as a web-portal, with a dedicated online news service
called Niconico News (\emph{nikoniko nyūsu} ニコニコニュース),\footnote{Tsuji
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-tsuji_eng._2017}{2017}) asserts that
  Netto-Uyoku are significantly more likely to read Niconico News, MSN
  Sankei News and jiji.com as their counterparts
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-tsuji_eng._2017}{2017}, 217)} as well as a
comics service and an online dictionary. Moreover, Niconico holds
in-depth monthly surveys polling political opinions\footnote{While
  Niconico holds non-political surveys as well, these are limited and
  almost exclusively on the topic of Japanese animation. See
  \url{https://enquete.nicovideo.jp/result} for such examples.} giving
both valuable insight into trends of political affiliation among its
users, and, perhaps, the intent of Niconico itself.\footnote{The one
  held on March 19, 2019 drew in 27,301 registered participants. Included
  questions ranged from a general ``Do you support the current Abe
  cabinet?'' (50 percent voted yes, 28.4 percent voted unsure), to
  questions as ``Prime Minister Abe Shinzō, based on the length of total
  tenure as prime minister, overtook Yoshida Shigeru in February
  reaching \nth{4} place, overtakes founding Prime Minister Hirobumi Itō
  in June, and overcoming the upcoming House of Councilors election will
  overtake Eisai Sato in July and Katsura Tarō in November, becoming No.
  1. Do you think that Prime Minister Abe has achieved significant
  political accomplishments corresponding with the length of his
  tenure?'' (48.5 of men and 36.0 percent of women said yes, for a total
  of 43.0 percent; 25.5 percent said no). Throughout the poll men support the LDP considerably higher as women (Nicovideo.jp
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-nicovideo.jp_monthly_2019}{2019}).}

\begin{figure}[!htb]

 \caption{\label{fig:murai-ratio} Breakdown of videos in (Niconico) ``Politics" category.}
 \includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth,trim=4 4 4 4,clip]{images/murai-ratio2.eps}
\end{figure}

Murai (\protect\hyperlink{ref-murai_net_2012}{2012}) uses Tsuji's
aforementioned classification to identify videos containing Netto-Uyoku
ideologies, finding 92.8 percent (3712/4000) of the top ranking videos
in the `Politics' category to be as such (see \textbf{figure
\ref{fig:murai-ratio}} for a breakdown per topic). He describes these
videos in his content analysis as deviant from the ``recreational
atmosphere of the other categories'', containing political messages
negative towards East Asian nations, the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ)
and the ``anti-Japanese'' mass media. He goes on to claim that ``these
conservative videos are usually filled with sympathetic comments by
anonymous viewers'' and that ``videos to condemn imagined enemies are
filled with harsh language, while scenes of `patriotic' activities are
praised as heroic.'' He fears that due to the mass quantity of such
videos in the `Politics' section, those political views will be
perceived as the standard and have a radicalizing effect on a demography
of mostly teens and those in their twenties (Murai
\protect\hyperlink{ref-murai_net_2012}{2012}, 369--71).

\section{Into the Twitter-sphere}\label{into-the-twitter-sphere}

Whereas 2channel and Niconico, despite undeniably popular, are still
associated with underground Internet subcultures, Twitter has rooted
itself firmly amongst Japanese Internet users; as of 2019 it is the
sixth most visited website in Japan, proceeding the less anonymous
Facebook. Furthermore, in 2013 Twitter's most used language was
Japanese and, according to a 2019 Bloomberg article, Japan became
Twitter's second-largest market. In 2016 another milestone was reached, with
one-third of Japan's population logging onto the site at least once
every month (Wang \protect\hyperlink{ref-wang_how_2019}{2019}).
Nevertheless, this latter article refers to ``hateful tweets that have
targeted minority groups'' and indeed, literature on the Netto-Uyoku has
noted seepage of 2channel and its rhetoric onto Twitter.

In 2015, Kanagawa University lecturer Taka Fumiaki held two quantitative
text analyses of a corpus of data containing Twitter messages related to
(ethnic) Koreans and one to China respectively (Taka
\protect\hyperlink{ref-taka_twitter_2015-1}{2015}\protect\hyperlink{ref-taka_twitter_2015-1}{b};
Taka
\protect\hyperlink{ref-taka_twitter_2015}{2015}\protect\hyperlink{ref-taka_twitter_2015}{a}).
Taka claims that since the 2011 earthquake, ethnic Koreans and those
without a Japanese passport residing in Japan have seen an increase in
hate, libel and false rumors. Between the period of November 5, 2012 and
February 16, 2013, Taka collected Korean-related tweets with a final
corpus of 109,589 tweets,\footnote{Which due the limitations of
  collecting data on Twitter cannot be claimed to be exhaustive.}
whereof 48,934 were retweets. Through a frequency analysis of the
contents of the tweets (which he further codified into topics such as
politics, historical problems, racism, 2channel and the call for
dispersion), Taka revealed that terms associated with socio-political
tensions or hate-speech far outweigh references to South Korean
pop-culture. Finally, through a sentiment analysis, he found the
majority of those messages (70\%) to be negative and dispersed by a
small group of users intending these messages to be further shared.
Moreover, he examined a distrust of mass media, reliance or links to
2channel and 2channel curated aggregation sites (\emph{matome}-blogs), a
belief in a ``hidden truth'' (\emph{``\,`Shinjitsu' ga kakusarete iru to
iu shin'nen''}, 「``真実'' が隠されているという信念」)\footnote{Something
  that---as some counter-movements on the Internet begin to consume
  Netto-Uyoku rhetoric as source of entertainment (\emph{neta},
  ネタ)---is in ironic matter referred to as `Truth through the
  Internet' (\emph{Netto de shinjitsu}, ネットde真実).} and critique of
anything self-identified as anti-Japanese (Taka
\protect\hyperlink{ref-taka_twitter_2015-1}{2015}\protect\hyperlink{ref-taka_twitter_2015-1}{b}).
His analysis of the corpus pertaining to China (a final corpus of 67,884
Tweets collected between September 19, 2012 and November 5, 2012,
whereof 25,139 were retweets) revealed the same trends, with beliefs in
truths hidden by mass media and negative sentiment that outweighs the
one seen in the Korean-related corpus; the latter most likely the
effects of South Korea's soft-power (Taka
\protect\hyperlink{ref-taka_twitter_2015}{2015}\protect\hyperlink{ref-taka_twitter_2015}{a}).

\end{figure}

Aichi Prefectural University lecturer Brett Hack follows up on Azuma's
notion of a pseudo-Japan and the subcultured status of nationalism by
referring to the \emph{otaku} subcultural elements amongst the
Netto-Uyoku. On the topic of Twitter, Hack refers to its presence in the
form of the `Japanese flag group' (`\emph{hi no maru kurasuta}',
日の丸クラスタ): users with Netto-Uyoku tendencies who have the Japanese
flag in their profile picture, preferably in combination with elements
of Japanese animation, militaristic imagery or both. \textbf{figure
\ref{fig:murai-ratio}} illustrates that. The rhetoric used in the
description of both user pages further fits Tsuji's
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-tsuji_eng:_2008}{2008}) classification of
Netto-Uyoku impeccably. The usage of \emph{Japanese subject}
(\emph{Nihon shinmin} 日本臣民) in \textbf{figure \ref{fig:twitter1}}
brings to mind a pre-war Japan with Japanese citizens as the subject of
the Japanese Emperor. This user further expresses support both for the
LDP and the Japan First Party founded by Zaitokukai's founder Sakurai
Makoto. The laws referred to,\footnote{The anti-terror laws refer to
  preemptive measures controversial for expanding police powers and
  threatening civil rights (Harding
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-harding_japan_2017}{2017}). The right to
  collective self-defense refers to article 9 of the Japanese
  constitution.} as well as a call for nuclear power, visits to the
Yasukuni Shrine, and the military aircraft Osprey\footnote{A military
  aircraft intended for deployment in Okinawa. Controversies are part of
  a greater debate on American military bases in Okinawa, and surround
  the safety of those aircrafts. This has led to several large-scale
  protests in Okinawa, especially after a fatal incident in Australia
  and a crash-landing of the coast of Okinawa in 2016.} are highly
controversial topics and seem to be intended as a reactionary, polemic
statement. The account shown in \textbf{figure \ref{fig:twitter2}} uses
the normative `Normal Japanese' construct, shows their support for a
constitutional amendment, has patriotic feelings and considers negative
feelings towards `leftists' (\emph{payoku}, パヨク)\footnote{A
  derogative term signifying left-wing ideologues, which this paper
  loosely translates as `leftists'.} and three `Tokutei' countries
(\emph{Tokua san-kakoku} 特亜三ヵ国)\footnote{Tokutei Asia (Specific
  Asia) is a pejorative for South Korea, North Korea and China as
  countries considered to have anti-Japanese sentiment.} to be normal,
perhaps leaning a tad on the right (\emph{choi migi}, チョイ右).

In their quantitative approach to Netto-Uyoku's usage of bots to spread
political propaganda during the 2014 General Election, Schäfer, Evert,
and Heinrich (\protect\hyperlink{ref-schafer_japans_2017}{2017}) argue
the importance of the Internet and social media usage by the Netto-Uyoku
in the outcome of Japan's General Election of 2014. `Bots' in their
study refers to ``computer-generated programs that post, tweet, or
message of their own accord'' (Schäfer, Evert, and Heinrich
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-schafer_japans_2017}{2017}), p.10) and indeed, a
linguistic analysis of their corpus of 542,584 tweets related to the
election (collected in a timespan of weeks before until the day after
the election) revealed, even when excluding retweets, 61.2 percent of
(near-)identical tweets. Interestingly, out of five recognized patterns,
four were associated with the usage of bots for `computational
propaganda campaigns' (either pro-Abe or generally right-wing).
Nevertheless, one pattern that was regarded as such were actual human
users sharing content through share buttons, in other words, a form of
human interaction through the technical particularities of social media
platforms to the point where it was detectable as the act of bots.

\section{Netto-Uyoku \& Politics}\label{netto-uyoku-politics}

If Netto-Uyoku, as illustrated in this chapter, show traits of historic
revisionism, xenophobia, antagonizing left-wing institutions and
generally show support for the LDP and Abe Shinzō in particular (whose
political career began in 1993 and whose family has deep roots in
politics), how then does that reflect on the LDP and Abe Shinzō himself?

In the aforementioned article by Morris-Suzuki
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-morris-suzuki_freedom_2013}{2013}), she recalls
an incident in January 2001, when shortly before the planned public
broadcast of an NHK documentary on wartime acts of violence against
women by the Japan military, the national broadcast service NHK was
forced to cut parts including testimony and preliminary findings. The
reason for this, as turns out later, was an implied censorship and
political interference by then Deputy Cabinet Secretary Abe Shinzō, who
allegedly opposed the biased nature of the show. As the media-scape
shifted, Abe Shinzō and a number of Japanese politicians including
Hashimoto Tōru\footnote{Former mayor of Osaka (2011 - 2015). He has been
  referred to as a neo-liberal populist skilled in media-usage, reaching
  over a million followers on Twitter in 2013 (Weathers
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-weathers_reformer_2014}{2014}, 83).} also
adapted to the usage of social media.\footnote{On a related note,
  electoral laws were altered in 2013 to permit explicit political
  campaigning on the Internet.} Next, Morris-Suzuki refers to a since
deleted post in which Abe Shinzō's secretary warns his followers for an
upcoming NHK show that would likely be negative on Abe Shinzō and
mobilizes his followers to send their thoughts to NHK's fax and Twitter.
A reply to this post by Abe Shinzō's own Facebook account stated: ``The
level of NHK's commentator is too low-level. {[}\ldots{}{]} Last time I
completely refuted it on Fuji TV. I would like to say, know some shame''
(\emph{``NHK no komentētāreberu o somatsu sugi.{[}\ldots{}{]} Kono mae
Fujiterebi de kanzen ronpa shimashitaga, hajiwoshire to ītaidesu
ne.''}「NHKのコメンテーターレベルお粗末過ぎ。{[}\ldots{}{]}この前フジテレビで完全論破しましたが、恥を知れといいたいですね」).\footnote{Although
  the original Facebook post and Abe's reaction are as of date not
  accessible anymore, briefly after it was posted a dedicated 2channel
  thread received 3000 comments spread over four hours, almost solely
  mocking Abe's usage of \emph{kanzen ronpa} (完全論破, lit. `complete
  refutation'), a term most of its users associated with Internet slang
  particular to 2channel. Fitting to Kitada's theory then, one user
  posted ``Abe-chan offers us periodic joke material, huh''
  (\emph{``Abe-chan wa teikitekini neta o teikyō shite kureru na''}
  「安倍ちゃんは定期的にネタを提供してくれるな」) (2ch.net
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-2ch.net_eng._2012}{2012}).}

Different from the rhetoric Abe applies in the offline world (having
formerly denounced the hate-speech associated with the ACM),\footnote{We
  refer in particular to his 2016 statement
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-abe_house_2016}{2016}) at the National Diet:
  ``The extreme behavior that attempts to exclude or instigate hate
  towards parts of the country, as well as towards some ethnic groups
  and cultures, is extremely disappointing and I strongly felt that this
  should never happen.'' (\emph{``Ichibu no kuni, soshite mata minzoku ya
  bunka o haijo shiyou to iu, aruiwa zōo o aoru yōna kagekina gendō wa,
  kore wa kiwamete zan'nendeari, kesshite a tte wa naranaito tsuyoku
  kanjita tokorodegozaimasu''},
  『一部の国、そしてまた民族や文化を排除しようという、あるいは憎悪をあおるような過激な言動は、これは極めて残念であり、決してあってはならないと強く感じたところでございます』).}
Shusuke Murai and Takeshi Suzuki
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-hollihan_how_2014}{2014}) also point out his
appeal to Netto-Uyoku sentiment in the online world. They then refer in
particular to a Facebook post that is, as of writing, still accessible
(Abe \protect\hyperlink{ref-abe_1_2012}{2012}):

\begin{quote}
Tomorrow, the elections deciding the future of Japan will finally begin.
The emerging China that does not hide their territorial ambitions
towards Japan. The illegal landing of the leaders of Korea and Russia on
the northern territories and Takeshima. Moreover, North Korea's missile
launch. How should we respond to such a crisis? Will we sit on our hands
with stopgap measures? Or will we build a new diplomatic history? If
Japan can change even just a little through this Internet call, it will
be the beginning of a new history. {[}\ldots{}{]} And thus, on the last
day the finale will be held by Mr.~Tarō Asō as a street address in
Akihabara (electricity street exit) from 19:00 at night. It may be cold,
but if we can fill Akihabara Ekimae with determined people, Japan will
without a doubt change. Why don't we let those in the mass media saying,
``On the \emph{internet}\ldots{} {[}italics added by the author to imply
derogatory intent{]}'' recognize grassroots power? Be sure to
participate. Let us change Japan from Akihabara!"
\end{quote}

While the mention of foreign threats is not unexpected, in a populist
fashion he explicitly appeals to the notion of the Internet as a
grassroots medium opposed to the established mainstream media, and
places himself among its `people'. Of significant note are his
deliberate references to Akihabara and former Prime Minister Tarō Asō,
who as of December 2012 serves as Deputy Prime Minister of Japan.
Akihabara, as Murai and Suzuki point out, is ``the symbolic center of
Otaku culture, and an essential destination for fans of Japanese anime
and manga'' (\protect\hyperlink{ref-hollihan_how_2014}{2014}, 190). Tarō
Asō, then, known not just for his revisionist views and political
gaffes,\footnote{One 2019 \emph{Washington Post} article reports a
  supposed `anti-gaffe' guide in wake of, amongst others, Asō Tarō's
  ``infamous remark in 2017 that while Hitler was `no good, his motive
  was right'\,'' and, in regards to a case of sexual harassment, that
  ``the media should assign only men to the Finance Ministry if they
  objected'' (Kashiwagi
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-kashiwagi_japan_2019}{2019}).} has positioned
himself as an \emph{otaku} and---deliberate or not---reinforced this
image after being spotted at an airport reading Japanese comics. Amongst
its mostly supportive reactions on this Facebook post, Murai and Suzuki
selected the following message as an one example of ideological overlap,
summarizing properly the portrait we have sketched of Netto-Uyoku
rhetoric (\protect\hyperlink{ref-hollihan_how_2014}{2014}, 190):

\begin{quote}
``Now, it will finally begin \ldots{} Japan has no other choices but
you, Mr.~Abe. We Japanese citizens can never repeat the same mistake of
three years ago. The mass media will certainly intensify their negative
campaign against you. But, ``Japanese citizens'' are on the side of
Mr.~Abe. We can never be defeated! Anti-Japanese activities of the China
and Korea, traitor activities of mass media, and disastrous politics of
DPJ have all sparked Japanese citizens to stand up. Let us show that
Japanese people's rage is something fearful! Then, Japan can overcome
the post-war regime and finally return to its own shape. We citizens
must protect Mr.~Abe with utmost effort \ldots{} Let us get back the
pride of Japan!''
\end{quote}

\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

The actions associated with the ACM, and in particular the Zaitokukai,
appear to be in decline. Since 2014 the amount of ACM demonstrations has
steadily decreased, Sakurai's debut in politics has seen little success
(albeit finishing \nth{5} out of 21 candidates during the Tokyo
gubernatorial elections). Moreover, the Zaitokukai and its associated
members' various online accounts have, under pressure of anti-hate
speech legislation, since been removed (Gill
\protect\hyperlink{ref-gill_nativist_2018}{2018}, 189--90). As this
paper will expand upon in the fourth chapter, on a grassroots level
Internet users have also taken action in their own hands, utilizing the
peculiarities of the World Wide Web and its interconnectedness to
alter perception and public opinion, as seen, for example, in
\textbf{figure \ref{fig:googlezaitokukai}}. Since Google (both in Japan
and worldwide the most used search-engine and visited website)
implemented its knowledge Panels, which draws its content from a variety
of user-generated content including Wikipedia, a Google search for
Zaitokukai now reveals decidedly negative content; both images contain a
snapshot with imagery of Adolf Hitler, and the English version in
particular refers to political extremism and terrorism.\footnote{This
  framing is not a deliberate choice by anyone related to Google and
  instead relies on user-generated content.}

This decline of real life manifestations does not, however, imply a
decline in Netto-Uyoku sentiment. Instead one could argue that the
perceived necessity for such manifestations has also declined due to
fading ideological boundaries between the current rendition of the LDP
and the Netto-Uyoku. Since 2012 the LDP has undeniably taken a shift to
the right, and in that sense, the ACM and the Netto-Uyoku might have
actually achieved their goal of normalizing neo-nationalist ideology
through wide-spread propaganda. Furthermore, we have argued in Sakurai's
case that he himself is a product of the discursive processes of
right-wing radicalization online. While an ongoing anti-Japanese
sentiment amongst some of Sakurai's perceived enemies is beyond dispute
(cyber-nationalism is not exclusive to Japan after all), the carefully
curated anti-Japanese elements dispersed online---regarded of as
purposefully hidden by the leftist mass media---make Baudrillard's
notion of hyper-reality feel all the more applicable.

Demographically at least, Morris-Suzuki
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-morris-suzuki_freedom_2013}{2013}) does not
appear to stray too much from the mark either. Tsuji
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-tsuji_eng:_2008}{2008};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-tsuji_eng._2017}{2017}) confirms a mostly male
audience active on 2channel and Niconico, and the latter in particular
contains dominantly \emph{otaku} elements, as Azuma
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-azuma_otaku:_2001}{2001}) himself suggested
earlier. In this context, the actions of LDP members like Asō Tarō and Abe Shinzō are all the more logical.

Is McLuhan's global village then an appropriate analogy for the Internet
and the World Wide Web, or does it instead stimulate stratification and
facilitate a globalized form of neo-nationalism of which the Netto-Uyoku
are just one instance? Murai
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-murai_net_2012}{2012}) and Sakamoto
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-sakamoto_koreans_2011}{2011}), both relying on
Sunstein's notions of online polarization and algorithmically sorted individualized
news sources (`Daily Me'), certainly seems to suggest the latter.
Moreover, following Kitada
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-kitada_eng:_2005}{2005}) and Anderson
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-anderson_imagined_2006}{2006}), a sense of
insider community on those online communities, arguably including those
in the English cyberspace,\footnote{This theory is particularly
  applicable to 4chan and Reddit as well, two platforms that have a high
  technical overlap with the ones mentioned above.} is formed through a
cynical language highly critical of mass-media.

\chapter{Cyber-nationalism and Japan --- Connecting the
Dots}\label{cyber-nationalism-and-japan-connecting-the-dots}

The previous chapter was a literature review of works describing the
phenomenon of Netto-Uyoku in relation to social media on the Internet, to
the so-called ACM real-life protests, and to the LDP. It further suggested
that the Netto-Uyoku adhere ideologically to a form of right-wing
populist nationalism (in other words, neo-nationalism) that does not
just take place on the Internet, but is further shaped by it as well. In
the first chapter we have further suggested that the Netto-Uyoku is but one
localized instance of this global phenomenon. Although this paper has so
far freely used concepts such as ideology, populism and
(neo-)nationalism, these terms are at an increasing risk of becoming
reduced to trending political abstractions due to over usage. Based on
the previous two chapters this chapter builds the theoretical groundings
of key terms through which we can interpret the underlying logics of
cyber-nationalism, as applied to the Netto-Uyoku.

\section{Conceptualizing Ideology}\label{conceptualizing-ideology}

``1. A system of ideas and ideals, especially one which forms the basis
of economic or political theory and policy. 2. The set of beliefs
characteristic of a social group or individual,'' thus defines the
online \emph{Oxford Dictionary} the concept of ideology
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-oxforddictionaries.com_ideology_2019}{2019}). In
his \emph{Ideology: An Introduction}
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-eagleton_ideology:_1991}{1991}), Terry Eagleton
agrees that such a pragmatic view on the notion of ideology is common in
public discourse (with the additional implication of the ideologue
having an oversimplified view of the world and thus, through
indoctrination, a distorted understanding of reality). Despite this, he
does warn, in light of the historical context briefly sketched below,
against one single comprehensive definition of ideology; especially one
that would contrast ideology with `pragmatism.'\footnote{``The term
  ideology, which had originally indicated a new science, became a
  condescending catch-word that served to demarcate political enemies.
  Ideology and ideologue began to connote the unwarranted interference
  of philosophical theory in political practices'' (Mudde
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-mudde_oxford_2013}{2013}, 19). These shifts
  are still on-going in today's political discourse and the term is
  often used in a dichotomous relationship to the truth or to a
  ``moderate position'' such as pragmatism. One recent piece by the USA
  political think tank Niskanen Center, for example, uses the terms
  ideologues and extremists interchangeably (Niskanen Center
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-niskanen_center_if_2019}{2019}), while a 2016
  Business Insider article paraphrases Barack Obama as calling Donald
  Trump pragmatic rather than ideological, ``someone who is stringently
  tied to a political philosophy'' (Darcy
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-darcy_obama_2016}{2016}) and Donald Trump, at
  the \nth{73} Session of the United Nations General Assembly, announced his
  rejection of the ``ideology Of globalism'' (Schwartz
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-schwartz_trump_2018}{2018}).} Martin
Heidegger's hermeneutics, after all, suggest it is impossible to
identify and judge an occurrence without a set of preconceived values,
and from the logic of Mannheim's Paradox too can we consider the
analysis of a world-view as an ideology possible only from the vantage
point of another ideological viewpoint
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-eagleton_ideology:_1991}{1991}, 1, pp.221-224).

Conceptualization of ideology has known many approaches. Historically,
the concept finds its roots in the French Revolution as a positivist
attempt to develop a new scientific framework of Enlightenment ideas
(`the discourse of patterns')---a form of skeptical scientific
materialism (Eagleton
\protect\hyperlink{ref-eagleton_ideology:_1991}{1991}, 70). Following
Napoleon's attack of the French `ideologues' as ``unrealistic escapism
and philosophical reverie,'' (Mudde
\protect\hyperlink{ref-mudde_oxford_2013}{2013}, 22) ideology has since
gone through several shifts in meaning. From a classical Marxist view,
as interpreted by Eagleton
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-eagleton_ideology:_1991}{1991}), ideology
represented a false or misleading awareness of the human situation as
well: a \emph{false consciousness}. Ideology was, however, to be
understood as an instrument of those in control of the means of
production. That is to say, as an instrument to steer---whether
intentional or not---the economically subservient class away from a
scientific, objective reality (from what is in the best interests of the
dominated class) and of one's ability to self-identify as an economic
class and express a political will. Hence maintaining the equilibrium of
this mode of production.\footnote{Summed up in the first chapter of
  Marx' \emph{Das Kapital} as ``Sie wissen das nicht, aber sie tun es,''
  or in English, ``They do not know it, but they do it.''} In other
words, classical Marxist materialist theory places ideology as a
`superstructure' in contrast to `reality', within a dialectic
basis-superstructure relationship: the dominant ideology is tied
directly to the base (the mode of production) and visa-versa.

On the precondition of being universally applicable, one could then, for
example, read in the the \emph{kokutai} (国体, `national body') notion
of national identity, or the state usage of folk traditions (state
shintō, 国家神道 \emph{kokka shintō}), of the Empire of Japan (the
Japanese nation-state between 1868 and 1947), the ideological means for
morally justifying exploitation (perhaps viewing the \emph{zaibatsu}
conglomerate as some sort of Japanese \emph{bourgeoisie}).\footnote{In
  \emph{The Japanese Economy}, Flath
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-flath_japanese_2005}{2005}) refers to the
  \emph{Zaibatsu} as ``at best a kind of \emph{petite bourgeoisie}
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-flath_japanese_2005}{2005}, 75). Miwa and
  Ramseyer (\protect\hyperlink{ref-miwa_fable_2010}{2010}) in polemic
  fashion dismiss the \emph{Keiretsu} and \emph{Zaibatsu} (industrial
  and financial business conglomerates) in its entirety as fictional
  scapegoats of''Marxist scholars in post-war Japan" and ``populist
  journalists'' (Miwa and Ramseyer
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-miwa_fable_2010}{2010}, 52). They further argue
  a historical growing demand for literature on Japanese economics and a
  lack of Japanese-literate Western economics who have resorted to
  accounts by academics from other disciplines, perpetuating
  conventional Japan-centric claims on \emph{main bank systems} and
  \emph{industrial policy} (Miwa and Ramseyer
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-miwa_fable_2010}{2010}, 54--57).} In contrast,
the ideologies of economic growth and the \emph{nihonjinron} breed of
ethnocentric nationalism during the era of the `Economic Miracle' would
serve to deprive or obscure an `objective' reality from the subservient
class; thus maintaining or legitimizing the \emph{status quo} of society
and its economic structures of exploitation. In a contemporary context,
we further see this line of reasoning in the Alt-Right and
Netto-Uyoku-appropriated conspiracy theories of `red-pilling' and
`waking up' (\emph{kakusei} 覚醒 or \emph{mesameru} 目覚める).\footnote{A
  concept Furuya Tsunehiro has referred to as a matrix-historical
  viewpoint, \emph{matorikksu-shikan} 「マトリックス史観」
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-furuya_eng._2015}{2015}).} This is a reference
to the main character of 1999 science fiction film \emph{The Matrix}.
After consuming a red pill the main character wakes up to a reality in which
humanity is enslaved as a source of energy for a large machine. The idea
of `waking up' or being `red-pilled' in this context refers to becoming
aware of a left-wing elite utilizing their dominance over
media to brainwash and exploit the ordinary people into believing a
fabricated world-view.

Such a line of thinking is nevertheless economically determinist, and
failure of Marx's proposed collapse of capitalist society betrays a
certain scientism and ahistoricism. Neither can we (despite at least
hints of a Taisho-era democracy) pinpoint an exact bourgeois revolution
within the transition from feudalism to capitalism in Japan. In
response, Karl Mannheim approached ideology as both the product of
unconscious assumptions guiding our lives on a psychological level, and
of our (social group's) position within social structures, on a social
level. For him, this Marxist interpretation of history \emph{itself} was
an ideology; and so too changed the pejorative notion of ideology and
started the idea of a `positive' ideology to counter class oppression
(Dijk and Fabra \protect\hyperlink{ref-van_dijk_politics_2006}{2006};
Mudde \protect\hyperlink{ref-mudde_oxford_2013}{2013}: ch.1-3). Since
the early writings on ideology, and with sociological developments such
as the linguistic turn, ideology as a concept has seen a wide range of
meanings, deeply entangled with the study of discourse, culture and
politics (Mudde \protect\hyperlink{ref-mudde_oxford_2013}{2013}: ch.1),
with contributions made by, amongst others, Marxist scholars Louis
Althusser, Georg Lukács (\emph{theory of reification})\footnote{Building
  on Marx' concept of false consciousness, Lukács theorized class
  consciousness as a class-bound ideology obtained through class-level
  self-awareness, the result of \emph{reification}. \emph{Reification}
  meaning the alienation of the self and a fragmented understanding of
  the totality, in the wake of Marx's notion of commodity fetishism and
  commodification of labor (Eagleton
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-eagleton_ideology:_1991}{1991}, 94--99).} and
Antonio Gramsci (\emph{theory of hegemony}), as well as Michel Foucault
and members of the Frankfurt School. Contributions that have helped
develop the relation between the Marxist notion of ideology and the
fields of culture and communication.

The debate on ideology has by no means stopped since then. Francis
Fukuyama (\protect\hyperlink{ref-fukuyama_end_1992}{1992}), for example,
claimed in his essay \emph{The End of History?} that we have reached a
post-ideological world in which western liberal democracy was the
end-point of ideological evolution, an idea that could not be improved
upon. On the other side, and furthering Lukács' ideas on alienation
caused by the increased penetration of commodity fetishism in capitalist
societies, Žižek views late-capitalist, post-modern cynicism (for Kitada
intrinsic to online communities such as 2channel) as inherent to
modern-day ideology. He summarized this as ``in contemporary societies,
democratic or totalitarian, \ldots{} cynical distance, laughter, irony,
are, so to speak, part of the game. The ruling ideology is not meant to
be taken seriously or literally'' (Žižek
\protect\hyperlink{ref-zizek_sublime_2008}{2008}, 28) and, in a playful
reference to Marx's take on ideology, as ``they know very well what they
are doing, but still, they are doing it'' (Žižek
\protect\hyperlink{ref-zizek_mapping_2012}{2012}, 18). We are aware of
the contradictions, of the false consciousness, but we renounce it only
in cynical subversion, and as Eagleton
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-eagleton_ideology:_1991}{1991}, 40) points out,
``the ruling ideology has already accommodated the fact that we will be
skeptical of it, and reorganized its discourses accordingly.''

In his approach to ideology critique, Eagleton recapitulates top down
from its most common to its most specific usage, in six points the
different epistemological perspectives on ideology (Eagleton
\protect\hyperlink{ref-eagleton_ideology:_1991}{1991}, 28--30; Fuchs
\protect\hyperlink{ref-fuchs_racism_2018}{2018}, 158--59):

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Ideology as the ``the general material processes of production of
  ideas, beliefs, and values in social life'' and ``the whole complex of
  signifying practices and symbolic processes in a particular society''
  (Eagleton \protect\hyperlink{ref-eagleton_ideology:_1991}{1991}, 28).
  In other words, a neutral, descriptive definition of ideology as
  \emph{culture}.
\item
  Ideology as the ``ideas and beliefs'' of a ``specific, socially
  significant group or class'' as ``a kind of collective symbolic
  self-expression'' (Eagleton
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-eagleton_ideology:_1991}{1991}, 29). In other
  words, ideology as a neutral \emph{world-view}.
\item
  Ideology as the ``promotion and legitimation of particular interests
  {[}\ldots{}{]} in the face of opposing interests'' and as rhetorical
  discourse, a ``discursive field in which self-promoting social powers
  conflict and collide over questions central to the reproduction of
  social power as a whole'' (Eagleton
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-eagleton_ideology:_1991}{1991}, 29). In this
  definition, ideology begins to be seen in relational, conflictive
  terms.
\item
  Like 3, the ``promotion and legitimation of sectoral interests'' but
  by ``a dominant social power.'' This perhaps in order to
  ``\emph{unify} a social formation in ways convenient for its rulers
  {[}\ldots{}{]} securing the complicity of subordinated classes and
  groups'' (Eagleton
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-eagleton_ideology:_1991}{1991}, 29--30). This
  definition refines the third definition.
\item
  Like 4, ``ideas and beliefs which help to legitimate interests of a
  ruling group or class'' but specifically through ``distortion and
  dissimulation'' (Eagleton
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-eagleton_ideology:_1991}{1991}, 30).
\item
  False or deceptive beliefs ``arising not from the interests of a
  dominant class but from the material structure of society as a whole''
  (Eagleton \protect\hyperlink{ref-eagleton_ideology:_1991}{1991}, 30),
  such as Marx's theory of commodity fetishism. The economic base
  determines the superstructure of ideology.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Hegemonic \&
Counter-Ideologies}\label{hegemonic-counter-ideologies}

The epistemologically neutral definitions we have seen courtesy of the
Oxford Dictionary fit in the first two descriptions given above, while
the last three are akin the Marxist tradition; the last one in
particular relating to so-called \emph{vulgar} or economically
reductionist Marxism. In these, power is a zero-sum game. The dominant
possession of power invariably reduces the power of the subservient
class. Gramsci expands upon this. After a failed communist uprising in
Italy, and in order to explain the failure of Marx' conception of the
inevitable proletarian revolution, Gramsci recognized culture (or
cultural \emph{soft} power) as an important factor, not sufficiently
taken in account for in traditional Marxist theory. Gramsci views the
state as a superstructure of Marx' base, consisting of a \emph{political
society} and a \emph{civil society}--- an \emph{integral state} in which
the latter is an essential component for maintaining consent and the
former is a means to coerce and discipline those who don't
consent.\footnote{These are concepts that Althusser has systematized as
  the \emph{ideological state apparatus} and \emph{repressive state
  apparatus}.}

Furthermore, Gramsci coins the notion of \emph{cultural
hegemony},\footnote{This paper's first chapter noted the Alt-Right's
  infatuation with Japan in particular. Asking why, one could without a
  doubt look at war-time relations between the far-right in the West and
  Japan. In Fukushima's mount Iimori, for example, this author examined
  both an archaeological column of Pompeii, donated by Italian fascist
  leader Mussolini, and a 1930s German donation in the form of a black
  granite plate with an Iron Cross. Those served as a form of praise for
  the \emph{bushido}-related war-time propagandistic media-event of the
  White Tiger Company military unit (\emph{Byakkotai}, 白虎隊), a story
  of nineteen teenagers committing ritual suicide after mistakenly
  believing their castle had fallen during the Bosshin War. Perhaps in
  more recent memory, one other answer could be found in processes of
  cultural hegemony between Japan and the West. With the widespread
  1980s narratives of Japan as economic powerhouse and the growing
  cultural \emph{soft} power of `Cool Japan', many a page were written
  on the \emph{Japanese model} (see for example Chalmers' 1982
  \emph{MITI and the Japanese Miracle}), and thus a window opened to
  sell Japan's hegemonic ideology of \emph{nihonjinron} (日本人論) style
  of (ethno-)nationalism to the West.} arguing that consent to the rule
of the governing class is a manufactured outcome of socialization and
promulgation of its ideology.\footnote{Although not from a Marxist
  school of thought, these topics have also been explored by Walter
  Lippmann in his seminal work \emph{Public Opinion} (1922) and Edward
  Samuel Herman and Noam Chomsky's work on propaganda (an ideological
  form of communication to gain consent) in mass media,
  \emph{Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media}.}
More specifically, promulgation through social institutions within civil
society: education, organized religion, the media industry, and the
entertainment industry. While the civil society is in modern capitalist
democratic nations formally not under control of the political society
(notwithstanding that Japan is ranked only \nth{67} in the 2019 World
Press Freedom Index),\footnote{Far below Belgium (9), the United Kingdom
  (33) South Korea (41) and the United States (48). This ranking is
  based on among others restrictions of journalism in official press
  rooms (take, for example, the concept of the `reporters club,' the 記者クラブ \emph{kisha
  kurabu}), strict policies against whistleblowers, and an increasingly
  hostile public climate towards public media (Japan : Tradition and
  Business Interests Reporters Without Borders
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-noauthor_japan_2019}{2019}).} they serve to
impose the state's dominant set of values as `common sense': the values
of the dominant class become accepted as that of society in general.
Predominance of the ruling class by coercion is in contrast restricted
to the level of political society, which includes institutions as the
government, police, judicial system and army. In a modern capitalist
state however, civil society and \emph{soft} power have grown to such an
extent that this `legitimized violence' has to certain degrees answer to
public consent; which again can be achieved through the dominant
ideology. Yet, if contradictions in the dominant ideology are too great,
the manufacturing of consent becomes unsustainable. In other words, this
leads to a \emph{hegemonic crisis}.

For Althusser, ideology was an \emph{unconscious}, discursive process;
assimilated and reproduced through cultural practices in the ideological
state apparatus; with little space for human agency. Gramsci does
however see space for that in his concept of civil society. Gramsci
coins the concept of \emph{subaltern} (a term crucial in post-colonial
studies)\footnote{In post-colonial theory, the concept of the subaltern
  refers to those in the margins of colonial society, lacking of agency
  and being forced to resort to speak the colonial oppressor's language.
  Crucial early works on the topic include Edward Said's
  \emph{Orientalism} (1978) and Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak's
  deconstruction \emph{Can the Subaltern Speak?} (1983), which
  criticizes the practice of interpreting the Other through western
  methodology (something the author of this very paper is guilty of as
  well).} to refer not just to those lacking in economic and political
power (such as peasants and the proletariat), but those whose cultural
or social identity is on the fringes of the dominant ideology; whose
history is overshadowed by that of the ruling class and who are denied
the right to make one's own culture and historical narratives. Yet in
those fringes is an opening to develop a subaltern consciousness, a
\emph{sub-culture}. For change to occur, it is therefore necessary for
those groups to dismantle the cultural hegemony by developing their own
organic ideology (a dialectic process of an `ideological struggle' with
the hegemonic ideologies) unifying a `collective will' as
class-consciousness and producing a \emph{counter-hegemony}. Only after
ascertaining a counter-hegemonic dominance on civil society could the
subservient classes succeed in coercive action over the political
society (Gramsci and Hoare
\protect\hyperlink{ref-gramsci_selections_1985}{1985},
210--38).\footnote{These concepts have been translated as \emph{War of
  Position} and \emph{War of Maneuver} (Buttigieg
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-buttigieg_gramsci_1995}{1995}; Gramsci and
  Hoare \protect\hyperlink{ref-gramsci_selections_1985}{1985}: p.46). It
  must be noted that this part of Gramsci's reasoning has since gained
  renewed popularity and seen appropriation by both Identitarian
  movements and the Alt-Right. Social institutions, education and the
  mass media are seen as platforms for manufacturing consent to a
  hegemonic left-wing or globalist ideology, and the notion of Gramsci's
  counter-hegemony is re-framed as \emph{metapolitics} (Stein
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-stein_jeff_2018}{2018}). Belgian populist
  right-wing party member Dries Van Langenhove claims his Identitarian
  youth movement Schild \& Vrienden to function as a vehicle of
  metapolitics (NWS \protect\hyperlink{ref-nws_van_2018}{2018}), and
  previous Vlaams Belang leader Filip de Winter added that ``The
  methodology Gramsci promoted is the right one'' (\emph{``De methodiek die
  Gramsci aanprees, is de juiste''}) (Ceulaer
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-ceulaer_6_2016}{2016}).} Gramsci calls this
\emph{passive revolution} (Gramsci and Hoare
\protect\hyperlink{ref-gramsci_selections_1985}{1985}, 106--20): in the
case of a crisis of hegemony, the dominant class has no means but to
either rely on coercion through the political society, or to consolidate
oppositional movements in civil society (the passive revolution).

If orthodox Marxism were to view the contradictory nature of poverty,
environmental problems and violent international conflicts in contrast
to the ideological narratives of capitalism as a trigger for working
class awareness and an inevitable revolution, then in Gramsci's
interpretation civil society would be the stage for the counter-hegemonic
processes of a passive revolution. The 1993 Japanese general election and
fall of the 1955 system\footnote{\emph{55-nen taisei} (55年体制). An
  electoral system of Single Non-transferable Vote in which the Liberal
  Democratic Party (LDP) held political dominance over the Japan
  Socialist Party (JSP).} could be read through this lens,\footnote{Although
  the democratic impact of the 1994 electoral system reforms in Japan is
  questionable considering the near constant dominance of the LDP on national politics since then (Komatsu
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-komatsu_first_2017}{2017}).} and although not
explicitly referring to Gramsci or Marxist traditions of ideology, the
language of John W. Dower in his narrative assessment of the New Left
and late '60s political movements certainly seem to suggest such logic
as well (Dower et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-dower_peace_1993}{1993}).
As Dower states, the growth of Japan as a cultural and economic
powerhouse brought to light contradictions in society---the \emph{San
Francisco System}, the ambiguous position of Okinawa and environmental
issues (in particular the mercury poisoning in Minamata) to name a few;
pitting ``liberal and left-wing critics against the dominant
conservative elites'' and introducing ``a more radical anti-imperialist
critique to the discourse on peace and democracy''
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-dower_peace_1993}{1993}, 5--6)

In light of rapid economic growth, hegemonic ideologies of nationalism,
capitalism, peace and democracy had thus far helped retain a strong,
manufactured grip on public consent, despite high profile political
scandals such as the Lockheed bribery.\footnote{This concerns the
  international bribing of political officials (which led to the
  incarceration of former Japanese Prime Minister Tanaka Kakuei) by the
  U.S. aerospace company Lockheed Corporation, to adopt its line of
  aircrafts.} As Dower puts it, the ``conservative hegemony-the bedrock
of the 1955 System-continued to rule japan''
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-dower_peace_1993}{1993}, 21). Nevertheless this
counter-hegemonic shakes society in the late '60s.

\begin{quote}
``It is estimated that between 1967 and 1970 alone, more than eighteen
million Japanese took to the streets to protest the war in Vietnam and
demand the reversion of Okinawa to Japan. Uncounted others were involved
in the university struggles and citizens' movements against the ravages
of the growth-oriented state. As elsewhere, `people's power' entered the
Japanese lexicon at this time as a legitimate and essential alternative
to bourgeois parliamentary politics; and, as elsewhere, the theory and
practice of `people's power' ranged from peaceful protest to wanton
violence. By the mid-1970s the nationwide people's movement was
moribund, but it left as legacies the memory and experience of
grass-roots mobilization that could be evoked in more particularistic
causes thereafter.'' (Dower et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-dower_peace_1993}{1993}, 22)
\end{quote}

This was a period of hegemonic crisis, but one that in its aftermath
left a considerably sour aftertaste in the mouths of many. Communist
groups associated with New Left thought, such as the Japanese Red Army
and the East Asia Anti-Japan Armed Front, immediately proceeded to
direct action and vise-versa so did the political society too respond
with violence. Nevertheless, along with the collapse of the bubble
economy, contradictions in the dominant, hegemonic ideology became
unearthed once again,\footnote{It could be said that Morita Akio and
  Ishihara Shintarō's 1989 \emph{The Japan That Can Say No} has not aged
  particularly well.} renewing distrust in established politics and the
political system behind it. In other words, the political reform of the
1955 System by temporarily allied political outsiders in 1994 was the
logical outcome of an increased alienated Japanese civil society.

Although the same could be argued for the election of the DPJ following over
another decade of national rule by the LDP and prolonged economic
recessions, after the DPJ's election the strong peak of interest into
the topic of `Netto-Uyoku', displayed in the previous chapter (see
\textbf{figure \ref{fig:nettouyoku}} or Fackler's 2010 \emph{The New
York Times} article) simultaneously indicates an increase of reactionary
rhetoric among Japanese cyber-nationalists that has moved into the
mainstream discourse. It is also around this time that the Zaitokukai
and related ACM groups gain notoriety for their aggressive marches, that
tensions surrounding territorial disputes are reignited, and,
furthermore, that populist political actors, such as Ishihara
Shintarō\footnote{Former governor of Tokyo (1999 - 2012), former leader
  of the Japan Restoration Party, and Member of the House of
  Representatives until 2014. In April 2012 Ishihara announced his
  intention to purchase the Pinnacle islands in response to the
  territorial dispute between Japan and China (where they are
  respectively known as the Senkaku Islands or Diaoyu Islands). His
  online-crowfunding campaign collected a reported 1,485,201,967 yen
  donated by 113,602 participants (Murai and Suzuki
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-hollihan_how_2014}{2014}, 185; Horiuchi
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-horiuchi_public_2014}{2014}, 36--38).} and
Hashimoto Tōru, gained increased support. The DPJ's period of rule
between 2009 and 2012 was plagued with several controversies, not the
least the aftermath of the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and the
Fukushima nuclear crisis; the latter incident drawing Japanese citizens
to alternative, online\footnote{In 2010 Japan had an Internet penetration rate
of 78.2 percent. In 2016 a white paper by the Ministry of
  Internal Affairs and Communications proclaims this to be 83.5 percent,
  with the age groups between 13 and 49 in particular all hovering
  between 97 an 99 percent (MIC
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-mic_communications_2017}{2017}).} means of
media ranging from Twitter to even 2channel\footnote{Concerning the
  earthquake, H. Slater, Nishimura, and Kindstrand
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-h._slater_social_2012}{2012}) state that
  rumors concerning plundering by ethnic Chinese and Koreans were
  recirculated from 2channel.} (H. Slater, Nishimura, and Kindstrand
\protect\hyperlink{ref-h._slater_social_2012}{2012}).

This paper views this Gramscian understanding of ideology and hegemony
as beneficial in understanding the processes of reasoning of
neo-nationalists (and, ultimately, `cyber-nationalists'). We find in
their rhetoric signs of the mass media representing the hegemonic
ideology. In other words, in such rhetoric the mass media functions to
`brainwash' into accepting a `false consciousness' and `distract' the people from
contradictions occurring in society (the `truth'). That, then,
concerns the perceived contradictions that arose during the period of
the DPJ's rule---both the territorial dispute with China and, in
particular, the lack of mainstream reporting and inefficient handling by
the ruling government of the 2011 Earthquake---aligned with the distrust
in mass-media that has been lingering amongst Netto-Uyoku, arguably
since the 2002 FIFA soccer match.\footnote{In which Netto-Uyoku
  perceived simultaneously a bias towards South Korea as well as
  anti-Japanese feelings amongst certain South Korean supporters.} It could then
be argued that both those populist right-wing political actors and the
Netto-Uyoku found fertile ground on the contradictions that arose during
that period to spread Netto-Uyoku ideologies in civil-society. We see
this underlying logic, for example, in two blog-entries from the
Wiki-style online blog ``Kokumin ga shiranai han'nichi no jittai''
(『国民が知らない反日の実態』, ``The actual situation of Anti-Japanese
sentiment, unknown to the nation's people''), translated by Murai as
follows (\protect\hyperlink{ref-hollihan_how_2014}{2014}, 173--74):

\begin{quote}
``What is happening in Japan now is not a war of military power, but an
information war to dominate the stream of information to secretly move
politics and invade a nation in a legitimate process. Anti-Japanese
power first dominates the mass media, brainwashes Japanese citizens, and
the brainwashed public votes for traitor candidates to become their
representatives. Then, the traitor politicians produce anti-Japanese
constitutions to hand Japan to an anti-Japanese power. These activities
are going through without the public even knowing them. Historically,
Japan has been weak in the information war . . . Can Japanese repeat the
same mistake?''
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
``Chinese Communist Party and Zainichi powers are trying to establish a
DPJ regime, which is a horrible traitor party, by controlling the mass
media to make Japan a subject state of China . . . Without knowing,
Japanese people have been brainwashed into the wrong direction because
of Zainichi's domination of the mainstream media. If you have a
stereotyped view that the Internet is evil or something dubious, that is
evidence you are the victim of the mass media's opinion control.''
\end{quote}

In both those examples its writer views mainstream media as a tool for
manufacturing consent from the masses to the hegemonic ideology (that of
the DPJ) and expresses sentiments of Gramsci's passive revolution.
Moreover, we read an underlying implication of the Internet and social
media, with their open and public nature, as ideal spaces—public spheres—for the
under-represented to form a cultural identity and engage in ideological
struggle with the hegemonic dominant ideology. If civil society is ``the
organized expression of the values and interests of society'' (Castells
\protect\hyperlink{ref-castells_new_2008}{2008}, 78), then Habermas'
notion of the \emph{public sphere} is where those values and interests
are discussed and formed, and in turn influence the decisions of
political society. In that sense, the rise of online \emph{influencers} using social
media such as YouTube, Niconico, Twitter, Instagram and Facebook to
spread politically inspired messages, and right-wing populists utilizing
this medium to sell a counter-hegemonic narrative does certainly seem to
suggest such a perception.

\section{Public Cyberspace}\label{public-cyberspace}

In his essay on global civil society and the public sphere, Castells
argues that ``there is a shift from a public sphere anchored around the
national institutions of territorially bound societies to a public
sphere {[}\ldots{}{]} built around the media communication system and
Internet networks, particularly in the social spaces of the Web 2.0, as
exemplified by YouTube, MySpace, Facebook, and the growing blogosphere
that by mid-2007 counted 70 million blogs and was doubling in size every
six months'' (\protect\hyperlink{ref-castells_new_2008}{2008}, 90).
Castell views the Internet (as a new public sphere) in an optimistic
sense: as ``the most effective form of broadening political
participation on a global scale, by inducing a fruitful, synergistic
connection between the government-based international institutions and
the global civil society''
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-castells_new_2008}{2008}, 90). This reasoning of
the Internet as a public sphere for political engagement and beneficial
to democracy, one that includes (political) minority groups that were
traditionally left out of the public sphere (amongst others, women, as
Habermas himself acknowledged) is not new. In an early stage of the
Internet's adoption in Japan, Rimmer and Morris-Suzuki
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-rimmer_japanese_1999}{1999}) wrote that
``frequently, this electronic version of civil society is seen as a
vehicle for the expression of opinions traditionally marginalised by the
political establishment---the opinions of women, ethnic minorities, the
young, etc'' (\protect\hyperlink{ref-rimmer_japanese_1999}{1999}, 1191).
Moreover, they further discuss sociologists Masuda Yoneji and Kumon
Shumpei's utopian views, who in similar sense to the previously mentioned discussions on the Internet as a global village, predicted that the Internet would serve
democracy by transforming its users into ``\,`netizens' in a virtual
community'', and leading to a power-shift away from mass-media
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-rimmer_japanese_1999}{1999}, 1191).\footnote{In
  reality, Sunstein's research arguing that algorithmically targeted
  advertisements and so-called `echo-chambers' have a politically
  polarizing effect on the current state of the World Wide Web (Sunstein
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-sunstein_republic:_2017}{2017}) suggests such
  views to be somewhat overly optimistic.}

We trace this ideological backdrop of the Internet as a new public space
to the development of the Internet and World Wide Web itself. As Aoki
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-aoki_virtual_1994}{1994}) writes, that
development in Japan has a similar history to the United States and
Europe, starting with universities developing technology to interlink
academic papers: JUNET (Japan University/UnixNETwork), the ``first
nationwide noncommercial computer network'', linked Tokyo University,
Keio University and the Tokyo Institute of Technology in 1984. According
to Barubora and Sayawaka
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-barubora_eng:_2017}{2017}), the loosening grip
of government policy in 1985 led to the consequent adaptation of
bulletin board systems (BBS) for computer-mediated communication between
hobbyists in Japan, and through translations in technological
magazines,\footnote{Such as Mitsuhiro Takemura's \emph{media ekusutashī}
  (メディア・エクスタシー, `Media Ecstasy') and Kazuhiko Nishi's
  『ASCII』 (\emph{asukī}, アスキー) and its spin-off \emph{roguin}
  (『ログイン』, LOGiN), although the latter gradually evolved into a
  solely gaming-centered magazine (the now famous \emph{Famitsu}). Its
  founder, Nishi Kazuhiko, is mostly known for his work on the Japanese
  desktop-computer PC-8001, and the development of the MSX in a joint
  project with Bill Gates.} the ideology of American west coast voices
crucial to the rise of Silicon Valley became known in Japan as
\emph{nishikaigan shisō} 西海岸思想 or \emph{Karuforunia shisō}
カリフォルニア思想 (West Coast Thought or California Thought). This
refers to an ideological viewpoint envisioning increased participation
in democracy through the development of IT and computer science. UNSW
Sydney lecturer Mark Rolfe writes about early narratives on the Internet
and the ``cyber-underground'', attributing ``American ideas of freedom,
anti-authoritarianism, individualism, and Wild West outlaws to the
hackers and the Internet. Many of these writers were sympathetic to the
1960s cultural revolution and preferred not to focus on the political
and bureaucratic background to the Internet's creation'' (Rolfe
\protect\hyperlink{ref-rolfe_reinvention_2016}{2016}, 135). Over a decade earlier, in
his own narrative on the development of computers and the Internet,
\emph{The New York Times} journalist John Markoff (who has an extensive
history writing on this topic) echoes such a connection of a libertarian
hackers-ethos to '60s counterculture as well
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-markoff_what_2005}{2005}).

Nevertheless, Barubora and Sayawaka
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-barubora_eng:_2017}{2017}) argue that while, as
Markoff and Rolfe too state, early rhetoric on the Internet in the united states
is built on newsgroups discussing political activities and usages of the
medium,\footnote{Such as John Gilmore's \emph{Cypherpunks} mailing list.
  Gilmore later co-founded the Electronic Frontier Foundation with John
  Perry Barlow, author of the 1996 \emph{A Declaration of the
  Independence of Cyberspace}.} in contrast were Japanese mailing lists
and BBS then primarily built around niche subculture topics
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-barubora_eng:_2017}{2017}, ch.1). Aoki
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-aoki_virtual_1994}{1994}) too argues that the
early adoption of computer-mediated communication (CMC) was associated with
\emph{otaku} (\emph{otaku-zoku}, オタク族, a term that at the time
roughly came to denote those with obsessive interests in subculture
topics). Moreover, CMC was less accessible to the public due to the
difficulty of encoding Japanese characters online (early communication
had to be written with the Latin script).\footnote{Which incidentally
  lies at the root of particular now `mainstream' \emph{net-slang}, such
  as the common usage of multiple letters `w' as signifier of humor (the
  loose equivalent of the now rather outdated `\emph{lol}', laughing out
  loud). As abbreviation of `(笑)' (\emph{wara}, `to laugh'), this
  \emph{slang} saw its first usage on platforms that required Japanese
  to be written with the Latin script.} Azuma argued the same, claiming
that since the beginning of computer mediated communication in Japan in
the '80s onwards, the discourse on Japanese Internet has been shaped by
\emph{otaku}; not just through websites and bulletin boards using
references to Japanese animation or video-games, but dispersed on a
technical level as well, such as in the naming of FTP-sites or sample
sentences in manuals for word or spreadsheet software
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-azuma_otaku:_2001}{2001}, 4).

\section{The Subculture Industry}\label{the-subculture-industry}

In the previous chapter, we discussed Azuma's
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-azuma_otaku:_2001}{2001}) suggestion that
right-wing discourse has become subcultured and `\emph{otaku}-ized',
with tendencies of creating an imaginary `pseudo-Japan' through
juxtaposing traditional Japanese motifs in faux \emph{otaku}-settings
(which we could, in Marxist terms, express as the fetishism of an
idealized Japan). Indeed the popularity of historical revisionist
comics, such as Sharin Yamano's 2004 - 2009 \emph{Manga Kenkanryū}
(『マンガ 嫌韓流』,``Hating the Korean Wave")\footnote{Which is
  discussed in Rosenbaum
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-rosenbaum_manga_2015}{2015}) as explicitly an
  expression of Netto-Uyoku sentiment. ``\emph{Manga Kenkanryū} is not
  just an isolated phenomenon, but rather largely a spillover of this
  radicalised Internet discourse. Popularised with the help of the
  Internet, the manga's success offline again had its repercussions
  online'' (\protect\hyperlink{ref-rosenbaum_manga_2015}{2015}, 218).
  Content-wise, the manga follows the same narrative of a `truth'
  concerning Japan and South Korea relations that is ``hidden by various
  powers, especially the (Japanese) mass media and the left''. That
  `truth', then, infers South Korea's role as ``a rapist and exploiting country that
  benefits from Japanese goodwill, plays the `history card', and calls
  for special rights''
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-rosenbaum_manga_2015}{2015}, 220--21).} and
Kobayashi Yoshinori's 1995 -- 2019 ''\emph{Gōmanism Sengen}"
(『ゴーマニズム宣言』, ``Gōmanism Manifesto''),\footnote{Sakamoto
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-sakamoto_will_2008}{2008}) describes this
  series as ``instrumental in popularizing the ideas of new-generation
  rightists and historical revisionists over the last decade''; an
  anti-elitist, anti-globalist an nationalist manga that attacks a
  supposed masochist view on history imposed by `leftist' war museums,
  intellectuals and ``leftist media'', while appealing to latent
  patriotism and ``{[}exploiting{]} the generalized sense of anxiety in
  contemporary Japanese society and nostalgically constructs war-time
  Japan as the good old days''. The latest \emph{Gōmanizumu sengen
  SPECIAL daitōa-ron saishū Fumi Chōsenhantō dōran su!}
  (『ゴーマニズム宣言SPECIAL　大東亜論　最終章　朝鮮半島動乱す！』,
  ``Gomanism Declaration SPECIAL Great East Asian Debate Final Chapter
  Korean Peninsula Disturbance!'') was published on June 2, 2019.} the
latter which Asō Tarō referred to as ``a masterpiece that directly
questioned young people about the meaning of war\ldots{}.'' (Penney
\protect\hyperlink{ref-penney_nationalism_2009}{2009}), or even the
existence of the highly ideological, political `Japanism' magazine
referenced earlier, give weight to his argument.\footnote{Although it should not be forgotten that there lies within the medium of Japanese
  visual arts a wide range of works countering such views,
  including not the least the distinct anti-war and historic
  deconstructionist comics by Tezuka Osamu.} Moreover, on a wider scale
we noted that the platforms Netto-Uyoku prefer, such as the anonymous
message-board 2channel and online video-service Niconico, appeal to such
\emph{otaku} subcultures as well. While the early rhetoric of the World
Wide Web as counter-cultural media has not escaped the online discourse
in Japan, we pointed out several authors suggesting that that very same
discourse was also shaped by \emph{otaku} subcultures.\footnote{As mentioned in the first chapter, on its American and European
  counterparts, we find particularly subcultures formed around video-games.} It is in that latter that we can then read Adorno and
Horkheimer's critique of the culture industry and commodification of
culture. Furthering Gramsci's idea of mass culture imposing and drawing
consent to the hegemonic ideology, Adorno and Horkheimer view
`commodified art' as the ``silencing of reflection'' and as ``removing
the thought that there is any alternative to the status quo'' (Adorno
and Bernstein \protect\hyperlink{ref-adorno_culture_2001}{2001}, 10).

In Macwilliams
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-macwilliams_japanese_2008}{2008}), the authors
go to certain extents to discredit Adorno's theorization when applied to
the \emph{manga} industry, rightfully arguing that, like any form of
media, ``manga and anime are anything but homogeneous in style, content,
characterization, themes, or meanings, as they are aimed at different
subcultures, age levels, and genders, and produced within ever-changing
social-historical contexts. Moreover, the fantasies they evoke are not
homogeneous either; they do not uniformly convey any master narrative or
transcendent system of capitalistic values to their audiences''
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-macwilliams_japanese_2008}{2008}, 9). Yet one
can but wonder how interested some of their audiences, what Azuma
describes as `\emph{animalized otaku}'---\emph{otaku} subculture fans
consuming such works based on their underlying recurring (visual) themes
(Azuma \protect\hyperlink{ref-azuma_otaku:_2001}{2001}, ch.2)---really
are in dissecting Tezuka Osamu's distinct panel design in \emph{``Hi no
tori''} (『火の鳥』, ``The Phoenix'') or Anno Hideaki's post-modernist
deconstruction of child-abuse in the hit-series \emph{Neon Genesis
Evangelion}.

In fact, the success of the Japanese cultural exports in the late
\nth{20} century and `mainstreaming' of \emph{otaku} subcultures is
referred to in the aptly titled \emph{The New York Times} article ``The
Year in Ideas; Pokémon Hegemon''. In that article Talbot
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-talbot_year_2002}{2002}) points out that
``though, so far, Japan's media exports don't convey an obvious or
coherent set of values -- akin to the capitalist individualism that
American pop culture tends to package, for example -- they might, if
Japan's culture-makers wake up to the consequences of their global
reach.'' Following Azuma's suggestion, it could be argued then that
these media exports instead convey the idea of a homogeneous Japanese
uniqueness not unlike the \emph{nihonjinron} form of ethno-nationalism
we have brought up earlier.

Finally, we should point out the relationship between the state and the
culture industry. The previous chapter established Niconico's usage by
political actors (including, in an early stage of online political
advertising, the LDP and Abe Shinzō), Asō Tarō's self-identification as
\emph{otaku}, and Abe Shinzō's appeal to Akihabara and online media.
Moreover, in the wake of the success of the Japanese cultural exports in
the late \nth{20} century, the Japanese government charged the Ministry
of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) with ``examining ways to encourage
the development and export of cultural industries'' (Otmazgin
\protect\hyperlink{ref-otmazgin_tail_2011}{2011}, 314), which has since
developed into a fully-fledged state-sponsored adaption of `Cool Japan'
as representing its national soft power. While METI's and the state's
actual contributions to the success of the now mainstream elements of
\emph{otaku} subculture are as arguable as the success of its
predecessor's (the Ministry of International Trade and Industry)
industrial policies and administrative guiding in Japan's previous
booming markets of computer hardware and the automobile industry, the
importance and reach of those \emph{otaku} elements in Japan's
far-reaching culture industry, at least, cannot be denied.

\section{Cyber-Nationalism}\label{cyber-nationalism}

The ideological backdrop we see in cyber-nationalism is one of
neo-nationalism or right-wing populism (which this paper has thus far
used interchangeably), shaped by the narrative of the Internet as a
counter-medium or a counter-public sphere. In his work on right-wing
populism in Europe, political scientist Cas Mudde describes the
underlying ideology of those movements as an ideology of nativism,
authoritarianism, and populism (Mudde
\protect\hyperlink{ref-mudde_oxford_2013}{2013}, ch.27; Beauchamp
\protect\hyperlink{ref-beauchamp_expert_2016}{2016}).

Disregarding the blatant dissimilarities in either political agenda or
geographical situation, politicians such as Donald Trump, Bernie
Sanders, Viktor Orbán, Jeremy Corbyn, Jair Bolsenaro and Matteo Salvini
have all been name-called as populists. The term, not unlike
`ideologue', has a distinct pejorative connotation, and theorization of
populism is, nearly as complicated as that of ideology itself.
Horkheimer, for example, wrote on populism in Nazi Germany, while Stuart
Hall coined the term authoritarian populism in Thatcher-era Great
Britain. Moreover, Laclau and Mouffe viewed populism in a more positive
light and, basing themselves on Gramscian notions of hegemony and
counter-hegemony, covered populism in relation to left-wing politics
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-laclau_populist_2005}{2005}). Populism in the
2010s is however undeniably linked to right-wing politics (a Google
Trends search for populism both worldwide and in Japan over the past ten
years, as illustrated on \textbf{figure \ref{fig:populismtrends}},
reveal a worldwide rise of public interest in populism correlating
seamlessly to those political shifts),\footnote{Although these worldwide
  trends reflect on Japan, they are preceded with a short but strong
  spike of interest in both July 2011 and August 2012, suggesting the
  concept of populism had penetrated Japanese public discourse a fair
  bit earlier as on a global scale. A period, barely a year after the
  devastating 2011 Tōhoku earthquake in which political outsiders
  Ishihara Shintarō and Hashimoto Tōru were making headlines, current
  prime minister Abe Shinzō was staging his political comeback, Tsuneo
  Watanabe, who was once called Japan's most powerful media baron
  (Onishi \protect\hyperlink{ref-onishi_shadow_2006}{2006}), publishes a
  book warning against the dangers of populist nationalism (Watanabe
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-watanabe_anti-populism_2012}{2012})), and
  literary critic Azuma Hiroki
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-azuma_ippan_2011}{2011}) gains renewed success
  with his publication of \emph{ippan-ishi 2.0} (General Will 2.0,
  一般意志2.0).} and the term populist is increasingly used
interchangeable or combined with demagoguery.\footnote{One \emph{The
  Huffington Post} article, for example, referred to Roman politician
  Publius Clodius Pulcher as ``the Trump of Ancient Rome, a Populist
  Demagogue Who Helped Bring Down the Republic'' (Freeman, professor,
  and author \protect\hyperlink{ref-freeman_meet_2016}{2016}).}

 \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth,trim=4 4 4 4,clip]{images/populismtrends.eps}\end{figure}

The definition most commonly referred to in the wake of this recent rise
in right-wing populism (Baker
\protect\hyperlink{ref-baker_we_2019}{2019}), though, is that of Mudde
and Kaltwasser's populism as a \emph{thin-centered} ideology. A
\emph{thin-centered} ideology because, according to Mudde, Kaltwasser
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-mudde_oxford_2013}{2013}), Abts and Rummens
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-abts_populism_2007}{2007}, 407--9) populism is
by itself not a fully-fledged world-view. They view populism in its
reduced form as the antagonistic struggle between a homogeneous
`People'\footnote{Which Taggart
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-taggart_populism_2000}{2000}) defines as the
  `heartland', an idealized, romanticized representation of the group
  the populist actor represents
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-taggart_populism_2000}{2000}, 95--98).} (the
in-group) and a homogeneous `Elite' (the out-group) based on their
social positions of power. The populist actors then frame themselves as defenders of this people's `Will', invoking Rousseau's notion of the
general will (and thus appealing to direct forms of democracy rather
than representative democracy). While the normative signifier of `the
People' refers to the ideal of one people or one nation, assuming a
homogeneous whole without taking into account pluralist differences, in
populist ideology the `Other' usually denotes a moral antagonist in the
form of a social or economic `elite' (`the establishment', such as
established politicians or media institutions), utilizing its
socio-economic `power' to oppress the `People'.\footnote{For research on
  a so-called ``Japanese model of populism'' (\emph{nihongata
  popyurizumu} 日本型ポピュリズム) see Otake
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-otake__2003}{2003}), Kimura
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-kimura__2006}{2006}), Matsutani Mitsuru
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-matsutani__2009}{2009};
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-matsutani_eng:_2010}{2010}), Yoshida
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-yoshida__2011}{2011}), and Kobori
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-kobori_populism_2013}{2013}). Their respective
  research typically begin with Koizumi Jun'ichirō's television play and
  utilization of so-called `wide-shows' and his utilization of
  television as a starting point, focusing on a neo-liberal economic
  populism.}

Under nativism, we understand a nationalism shaped predominantly by
xenophobia. In other words, when we think of nationalism as an ideology,
it is one of imaginary kinship based on the nation and a homogeneous,
national identity. This national identity, the `in-group', can be
cultural (sharing the same cultural values) just as well as that it can
be based on imagined ethnic or `racial' similarities. Xenophobia, then,
involves the creation of the `Other' or the `out-group'. It underlines
the perceived differences between those of the in-group and of the
out-group, and in this paper's understanding of ideology, distracts from
contradictions in society by antagonizing that latter group. So too do
Netto-Uyoku differentiate on what is Japanese and what is not, viewing
not just foreign nations (China and South-Korea) as a threat, but also
the ethnic Korean diaspora, most of whom have lived in Japan for
several generations. Those latter serve, in particular, as scapegoats for
social problems (ranging from being blamed for particular crimes to
having infiltrated the DPJ to push through `anti-Japanese' policies).
Finally, authoritarianism is the believe in strong, centralized
political power and in a strictly ordered, law-and-order society (see,
for example, the support portrayed in \textbf{figure \ref{fig:twitter}}
towards the LDP's anti-terrorism laws, or even the support for a
constitutional amendment).

\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion-1}

This paper takes a critical approach to ideology, viewing it as a
world-view rooted in conflict and---in capitalist nations that rely on
consent over coercion---as a means to distract from what is in the best
interest of exploited groups. Consent is drawn by those in control of the
political society (the `elite' or establishment) through disseminating
ideology by means of popular culture and mainstream media in civil
society: the hegemonic ideology. The alienating effect of contradictions
in society---a consequence of the capitalist nature of commodity
fetishism---bring about class-awareness among the exploited and an
opening for counter-hegemonic processes in civil society.

It is this very line of reasoning, however, that is of essence in
right-wing populist antagonization of an `elite' for the sake of a
homogeneous `will' of `the people'. Right-wing populists view the
`elite' in this case as primarily a left-wing entity utilizing the media
to spread manufactured consent through a \emph{fake consciousness}. In
this narrative the populist actors are the counter-hegemonic forces,
utilizing alternative means in civil-society to appeal to `the people' as
exploited classes that are more often than not defined based on
nationalist ideologies such as ethnic background or cultural values
(i.e.~Judeo-Christian values or Japanese \emph{nihonjinron}
essentialism). This \emph{fake consciousness} borders on a nativist
conspiracy theory wherein globalist values of the elite lead to clashes
of culture and the disintegration of `the people's' best interest
(i.e.~the DPJ as a puppet-government utilizing mass media to work
against the best interest of the `Japanese people', or the constitution
as as imposed by an invading force).

Based on the literature review of Netto-Uyoku in the previous chapter,
this chapter attempted to conceptualize cyber-nationalism. That, as a
form of such neo-nationalist ideology shaped by the populist discourse
concerning the World Wide Web as a public sphere for disseminating
counter-hegemonic narratives. This paper, after all, argues a difference
between those that adhere to neo-nationalist ideologies and utilize the
Internet purely for organizational means, and so-called \emph{netizens}
as a subculture adhering to an ideology of the World Wide Web as a `new
frontier' in contrast to `mass media'.

If self-perceived contradictions in society (such as immigration and
terrorism) brought about a wave of right-wing populism with in
particular 2016 as a pivotal year, then the period in which the DPJ
governed could be considered the same for Japan. Moreover, in the
previous chapter we argued that Abe Shinzō skillfully employed populist
tactics common to the right-wing populist actors that have dominated the
global political scene since the latter 2010s and in particular drew
support from the Netto-Uyoku by appealing to the Internet as grassroots
media and continuously attacking mass-media. This chapter further notes
the dominance of mass culture (the culture industry) in Japanese society
and in particular on the Japanese Internet, which disperses the notion
of a nationalist Japanese uniqueness both nationally and internationally
(hence perpetuating the homogeneous image of Japan amongst some of the
international aficionados of \emph{otaku} subculture media).

In the next chapter we will then attempt to uncover how Internet users
expressing Netto-Uyoku sentiment utilize the Internet to disperse their
self-perceived counter-hegemonic ideologies.

\chapter{The Anatomy of Japanese Cyber-nationalism ー From 2channel to
Wikipedia}\label{the-anatomy-of-japanese-cyber-nationalism-ux30fc-from-2channel-to-wikipedia}

This paper illustrated in the second chapter that Netto-Uyoku are often
associated particularly with 2channel, Niconico and with its more recent
rise of usage in Japan, with Twitter as well (Katayama
\protect\hyperlink{ref-katayama_2-channel_2007}{2007}; Tsuji
\protect\hyperlink{ref-tsuji_eng:_2008}{2008}; Sakamoto
\protect\hyperlink{ref-sakamoto_koreans_2011}{2011}; Murai
\protect\hyperlink{ref-murai_net_2012}{2012}; Yasuda
\protect\hyperlink{ref-yasuda_eng:_2012}{2012}; Morris-Suzuki
\protect\hyperlink{ref-morris-suzuki_freedom_2013}{2013}; Taka
\protect\hyperlink{ref-taka_twitter_2015-1}{2015}\protect\hyperlink{ref-taka_twitter_2015-1}{b}).
Furthermore, all of these belong to the top visited websites in Japan,
with the latter two dominantly fixed in the top ten.\footnote{For more
  information, see \textbf{table \ref{tab:50mostpopjp}}.}

In 1964, McLuhan
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-mcluhan_understanding_1994}{1994}) famously
argued that the content of the message is itself intrinsically shaped by
the vessel through which it is delivered (``The medium is the
message''). Following this argument through in the age of online social
media, Lev Manovich argues that software now takes a central position in
our interaction with the world around us
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-manovich_software_2013}{2013}). As someone
creates a potentially viral image intended for political persuasion and
posts it online, they might do so using their laptop computer to edit
different layers of the image through image-editing software as
Photoshop. Next they might use Chrome as a browser to interpret and
visualize the semantic text of the World Wide Web (HTML), and upload the
image on a platform as Twitter or 2channel. They have to adhere to the
limits required on image-size and length of text, and preferably add
symbols for interconnection or recognition to gain a wider reach (using
hash-tags, the @ sign, or \emph{trip-code} identifiers on
pseudo-anonymous Bulletin Board Systems). Combined, these are a great
amount of different interfaces for communication. Azuma
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-azuma_otaku:_2001}{2001}) expresses similar
reasoning. Whereas the content of other media has one final represented
form, data on the World Wide Web is determined by software. A web-page
built using the HTML syntax will represent the contents in a different
fashion depending on the software and hardware it is opened with, and
reveals the underlying structural composition when opened with a
text-editor instead of a browser. Furthermore, similar to the non-linear
structure of games as a medum, non-linear paths are an intrinsic element of the
world wide web's \emph{hyper-connectedness}
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-azuma_otaku:_2001}{2001}, ch.3).

Since the effective start in the mid 2000s of what Tim O'Reilly coined
the \emph{Web 2.0}---a participatory web based on interactive
collaboration and user-generated content---as well as the onset of
machine learning and artificial intelligence in generating semantically
interlinked content, over a decade has passed for social media and its
hyper-extended hyper-connectedness to mature within our lives.
Based on the theoretical framework in the previous chapter, we approach
this chapter through a mixed methods critical content analysis applied
to social media, attempting to bring to light from a semiotic
perspective how the Netto-Uyoku reinforce and disperse ideological
narratives on the Internet. While it is hard to ignore major platforms
as YouTube, Twitter and 2channel, this chapter will focus particularly
on two forms of Internet-based media in Japan that are in academia
less-documented: 2channel-based \emph{matome} curated aggregation
websites and Wikipedia. The former as a means to disperse to a greater
audience a selected sample of certain sub-categories as supposedly
representative of the Internet \emph{vox populi}. The latter then, an
open and collaborative encyclopedia built on hyper-links, is both a
prime example of Azumi's idea of a non-linear and endless structure
inherent to the world wide web and, more concretely, gives us through
its revision history insights in how and by whom persuasive narratives
are formed.

\section{\texorpdfstring{2channel \&
\emph{Matome}-blogs}{2channel \& Matome-blogs}}\label{channel-matome-blogs}

Although we cannot dismiss previous literature in tracing the
\emph{Netto-Uyoku} and their rhetorical methods back to
2channel,\footnote{Take for example the suffix \emph{nida} 「～ﾆﾀﾞ」 as
  a pejorative expression in imitating someone with an ethnic Korean
  background.} it would be unwise to dismiss those platforms in their
whole as one homogeneous, even toxic community (with at their peak
millions of messages posted every day).\footnote{Katayama
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-katayama_2-channel_2007}{2007}) reported in
  2017 2.7 million messages per day spread over 800 different
  categories. Whereas 2channel was in 2017, a decade after that report,
  still the \nth{18} most visited website in Japan (Poppe
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-poppe_digitaal_2017}{2017}, 15), in its current
  renamed state as 5channel it has since dropped to \nth{43} position.}

The technical base behind 2channel was created in 1999 based on the
structure of early Usenet-inspired Bulletin Board Systems \emph{ayashī
wārudo} あやしいわーるど (1996, lit. `Strange World') and \emph{amezō
rinku} あめぞうリンク (1997), purposed as a text-only multi-threaded
anonymous messaging board
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-barubora_eng:_2017}{2017}, ch.2). These were
subsequently the origin for the more graphically-oriented \emph{Futaba
Channel}, the software base on which \emph{4chan} is based on. While
correctly identified as strictly anonymous, users have the option to
register a personal identifier (a trip-code). Moreover, messages
(\emph{posts}) have a numeral ID used when reacting to another post, and
within one \emph{thread} (a conversation on one particular topic) users
often have a fixed ID to keep some consistency in communication. A
thread has a limit of 1000 posts before it is `archived' (meaning no new
reactions can be placed) and users need to create a follow-up thread.
Similar to the structure of news websites, those approximately 800
boards are thematically divided (including such topics as news, society,
sports, idols and video-games). A 2channel ranking-site (based on the
amount of threads and replies within a certain timespan)\footnote{See
  \url{http://2ch-ranking.net/} for those real-time rankings.}
consistently places boards belonging to the news section on top, as well
as several boards dedicated to idol culture.

One trend that accompanied the growth of 2channel is the appearance of
so-called \emph{matome}-sites. Those are curated aggregation websites
based around particularly popular (\emph{viral}) threads on 2channel
(and since the early 2010s other social media platforms such as
Twitter). The curator manually collects the material deemed most
relevant to the viral topic in question---either as representation of
public opinion, or for its comical value---and is usually accompanied
with a particularly appealing title (what is in English colloquially
known as `clickbait') and a short personal comment. A common trait of
those \emph{matome}-sites is the usage of private advertising or
services such as Google's Adsense for the pursuit of financial
profit,\footnote{This is pejoratively known as \emph{afikasu}
  アフィカス, a contraction of \emph{afiriēto} アフィリエイト and
  \emph{kasu} カス, loosely translated as `affiliate-tainted'.} and one
of the larger subsections (boards) of 2channel, \emph{Nyūsu sokuhō
(kenmō)} ニュース速報 (嫌儲)\footnote{A subdivision of the
  \emph{Breaking News} boards. 嫌儲 \emph{kenmō} is a word play on 嫌韓
  \emph{kenkan} (lit. `Hate Korea') and translates to `Hate Profit'. The
  URL itself \url{https://5ch.net/poverty/} itself contains an English
  language pun.} started in protest of such curated aggregation sites
and may by terms of service not be aggregated.

 \caption{ASCII Art (AA) parodying Netto-Uyoku}\label{fig:aa}
\end{figure}

In a July 15, 2019 thread on this board, users discuss if and why there
are less expressions of Netto-Uyoku discourse on \emph{kenmō}. There is
no consistent political ideology amongst its users (who refer to
themselves as \emph{kenmomen} ケンモメン or 嫌儲民), but in an
interesting group dynamic there exists a perception of the other \emph{nyūsu
sokuhō} boards as some form of cultural Other, with an overall resistance to
profit-seeking aggregation sites and writers targeting the medium they
identify with.\footnote{Referred to as \emph{biji-uyo} (ビジウヨ, an
  abbreviation of business-right, \emph{bijinesu-uyoku} ビジネス右翼)
  and \emph{sutema sōdō} (ステマ騒動, stealth-market unrest).} Through
somewhat serious discussion on nationalism and ideology (alongside
occasional conspiracy theories),\footnote{Several reactions claim
  mind-control (i.e.~Marx' notion of `false consciousness') by the
  left-wing and ethnic outsiders. See for example: ``...In spite of
  being controlled by the baby boomer leftists, and Zainichi Koreans and
  Chinese'' (\emph{zainichi chūgokujin, zainichi kankokujin, dankai
  sayoku ni kontorōru saretekita baka no kuse ni yo}
  「在日中国人、在日韓国人、団塊サヨクにコントロールされてきたバカのくせによ」).}
several users echo the 2011 earthquake as a trigger for psychological
cravings for positive nationalist self-reinforcement and view
\emph{matome} blogs as one such tool. Conclusively, these
\emph{kenmomen} dislike profit-seeking \emph{matome} blogs and
marketers, therefore they reason they have not become \emph{Netto-Uyoku}
themselves (which are often subject to parody, as illustrated on
\textbf{figure \ref{fig:aa}}).\footnote{An earlier trend on 2channel and
  similar message-boards was the usage of text-based artwork (AA, ASCII
  Artwork), the Japanese variant of the viral imagery referred to as
  \emph{memes}. While somewhat out of fashion, they are now recycled in
  an ironic manner.} One anonymous user summarizes their answer to the
thread's question as follows (5ch.net
\protect\hyperlink{ref-5ch.net_eng._2019}{2019}):

\begin{quote}
「右翼とか左翼以前に世の中の天邪鬼なのがネットの主流だから\newline

\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
``\emph{Uyoku toka sayoku izen ni yononaka no amanojakuna no ga netto no

\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
``It's because since before all of this left-wing or right-wing talk,
the voice of the Internet was this world's contrarian. When the
Netto-Uyoku were still considered to be intelligent, television, public
opinion and such were still left-leaning. Since they have become
Netto-Uyoku themselves, we have to create a counter-balance to the left.
At least there is such kind of subconscious reasoning.''
\end{quote}

Of note is the implicit ideological reasoning of the Internet as a
`contrarian' public sphere.\footnote{In a February 21, 2016 thread
  that is now comically referred to as \emph{poverlution} (a contraction
  of the board's URL-name `poverty' and `revolution') and プリキュア革命
  (\emph{purikyua kakumei}, a reference to an animation `Pretty Cure'),
  a user asks ``I'm thinking about bringing about a labor revolution in
  this rotten country Japan. Violence is out of the question. What can
  we do?'' (\emph{`Kono kusatta kuni, nihon de rōdō-sha kakumei o okosō
  to omō bōryoku wa NG dōsureba ii?'}
  「この腐った国、日本で労働者革命を起こそうと思う　暴力はNG　どうすればいい？」).
  In a similar trend to the `Anonymous' movement associated with 4chan,
  a general distrust in mass media was noticeable and users discussed
  things as cyber-terrorism, strikes and the control of information.
  While this was the subject of much ridicule, The thread reached its
  limit of 1000 posts in less than two hours (5ch.net
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-5ch.net_eng._2016}{2016}).} When
referring to public opinion being Netto-Uyoku in nature, this user implies that
the Netto-Uyoku counter-ideology has successfully spread over civil
society and become the hegemonic ideology. In their reasoning, these
\emph{kenmomen} present a counter-balance. Or as one user claims, ``the ideology
of the \emph{kenmomen} will, maybe after around two years or so, have
without a doubt become the Net-mainstream''
(「多分2年後くらいは嫌儲思想がネットの主流に間違いなくなっている」
\emph{``tabun 2-nen-go kurai wa kenmō shisō ga netto no shuryū ni

One thread observed during this paper's writing process, is particularly
suitable for demonstrating the reach of \emph{matome} sites. On July 8,
2019 a South Korean YouTube \emph{vlogger} posted a video complaining
about the rising nationalist trade conflicts between South Korea. In the
wake of public protests and various boycotts against Japanese products
in South Korea, he tore up his airplane ticket for a planned trip to
Japan and stated there are other places in the world to visit
(daelyugnamTV \protect\hyperlink{ref-daelyugnamtv_eng._2019}{2019}). On
July 11, 2019 4:40 P.M. an aggregation website called Record China
(\emph{rekōdochaina}, レコードチャイナ), claiming to offer information
of Chinese events towards a Japanese audience, published an article on
this video (Kitada
\protect\hyperlink{ref-kitada_eng._2019}{2019}).\footnote{Accredited to
  an otherwise anonymous Kitada (北田), someone who is not listed among

\protect\hyperlink{ref-anonymous_post_eng._2019}{2019}). Although not
indicating where this populist notion of the people's `Internet
reaction' came from, a quick comparison traced every listed `Internet
reaction' back to the 2channel thread in question. This story was
subsequently shared on their Twitter-account with over 135,000
followers. At midnight, july 12, 2019 1:30 A.M. another aggregation site
focusing primarily on video-games and animation (\emph{Hachima Kiko}
はちま起稿) picked up on this story (Hachima Kiko
\protect\hyperlink{ref-hachima_kiko_eng:_2019}{2019}). On July 15, 2019 pop-culture news-blog SoraNews24 posts an English version of this story
sourcing Hachima Kiko, which was subsequently shared on online newspaper
Japan Today (Japan Today
\protect\hyperlink{ref-japan_today_popular_2019}{2019}), as well on 
Japan Today's Facebook page (which has as of writing over 1,3 million
followers)\footnote{Japan Today shared this story on Facebook twice,
  once on July 15, 2019 7:10 P.M., receiving at over 160 comments, and
  again shortly afterwards on July 15, 2019 7:32 P.M., when it received
  over 500 reactions and 170 shares.} and finally reached 4chan's
`/pol/' discussion board, associated with English-language
cyber-nationalists (referred to in the first chapter).

SoraNews24 and Japan Today failed to include any of the socio-political
context presented in the video. Moreover it contained false claims that
the South Korean YouTube vlogger ``had driven all the way down to the
airport to purchase a flight ticket to Japan worth 1.35 million won
(\$1,150)'' and that ``he could potentially walk up to a counter for a
ticket refund,'' while in fact the vlogger had purchased this ticket
prior to the political tensions. Although Hachima Kiko did not list the
former information, it explicitly mentions the YouTube vlogger's claim
that canceling the ticket and hotel is impossible. The YouTube video has
as of July 17, 2019 reached over 316,000 views, and its comment section,
with over 10,000 comments, has seen an influx of English and Japanese
reactions.\footnote{One interesting observation was the frequent claim,
  in English, that this YouTuber is in fact Chinese and not Korean.}
Disregarding the actual contents of this video, in just one week, a
story magnified by echo-chambers of one particular sub-community on
2channel find its way to a common media-platform presenting English news
on Japan---echoing the distorted bias the story had gained in this
process.

Moreover, one of those \emph{matome} sites listed above, Hoshu Sokuhō,
was linked to on November 24, 2014 in a since removed message on Prime
Minister Abe Shinzō's Facebook and Twitter account. Earlier, that
\emph{matome} site had been sued by the ethnic Korean freelance writer
Lee Sinhae for libel (The Huffington Post JP
\protect\hyperlink{ref-the_huffington_post_jp_lee_2014}{2014}; J-CAST
News \protect\hyperlink{ref-j-cast_news_eng:_2014}{2014}).\footnote{A
  judicial decision ordered a compensation of 2 million yen in favor of
  the journalist, which was confirmed in a final decision on 11-12-2018
  in her favor after an appeal by \emph{hoshu sokuhō} to the highest
  court was won (Okamoto
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-okamoto_eng:_2018}{2018}).} The repercussions
of the lawsuit have led to \emph{hoshu sokuhō} support by other popular
\emph{matome} blogs and the withdrawal of \emph{hoshu sokuhō}'s sponsors
and Google Adsense Support, as illustrated on \textbf{figure
\ref{fig:matome-examples}}.\footnote{Council member and blogger Kotsubo
  Shinya (whose blog is located at the subtly-titled
  \emph{samurai20.jp}) defended \emph{hoshu sokuhō} with the argument
  that freedom of speech should be absolute and suggested selling goods
  such as bookmarks as income replacement (Furuta and Harimaya
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-furuta_eng:_2018}{2018}).}

Disregarding the content of the aggregated items in \textbf{figure
\ref{fig:matome-examples}} (it should by now not be particularly
surprising that most items are related to Korean topics or left-wing
politics, often accompanied with the rhetorical device of '\emph{w}'s
for intended ridicule), two other things are of note. On \textbf{figure
\ref{fig:moeruasia}}, \emph{Moeruasia} uses the ethnic slur \emph{chon}
チョン as well as \emph{hibyō} / \emph{hwabyeong} (火病, a term
referring to a culture-bound mental illness associated with ethnic Koreans). In the wake of this trial,
such \emph{matome} blogs have out precaution since opted to exclude
messages with explicit racial hatred from their aggregated posts.

\begin{quote}
「【チョン悲報】李信恵さん、保守速報の弁護士に正論で完全論破され火病、泣き落としにｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗ」

{[}Tragic \emph{Chon} News{]} Lee Sinhae was completely refuted by the
sound reasoning of Hoshu Sokuho's lawyer; falls into mental illness and

\end{quote}

The second point of note is on the screenshot of \emph{hoshu sokuhō}
(see \textbf{figure \ref{fig:hoshusokuho}}). As of July, 15 2019
\emph{hoshu sokuhō} is still in search of adverts. Whereas this blog had
previously been supported by ads of large companies as Epson (Hatachi
\protect\hyperlink{ref-hatachi__2018}{2018}), only one advertisement is
filled out (with a reference to a small-scale web-comic). To the left is
an advertisement for an unofficial fan-blog of Toranomon News
(\emph{toranomon nyūsu}, 虎ノ門ニュース).\footnote{This name most likely
  refers to the December 27, 1923 Toranomon incident (\emph{toranomon
  jiken}, 虎ノ門事件), an assassination attempt of the then Prince
  Regent Hirohito, committed under influence of left-wing ideologies.}
Although there is no substantial link between \emph{hoshu sokuhō} and
Toranomon News aside from a mutual target audience, we find that, as a
conservative web-show drawing up to a combined half a million viewers
within its first day on YouTube and Niconico, Toranomon News is worth
briefly expanding upon for both its eclectic cast of ultra-right
conservative regular speakers as well as for its plethora of guest
speakers (see \textbf{figure \ref{fig:toranomon}}).

\section{Toranomon News}\label{toranomon-news}

Sponsored by DHC Television,\footnote{Another show of DHC Television,
  News Girl (``\emph{Nyūsu joshi}'', 『ニュース女子』), gained criticism
  for its libelous reporting of a protest march in Okinawa in January
  2017, claiming that the demonstrators looked like terrorists, were
  being bribed, blocked ambulances and had (ethnic) Koreans amongst them
  (SANKEI DIGITAL INC
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-sankei_digital_inc_eng._2017}{2017}). Its panel
  and guest list overlaps with that of Toranomon News, and includes
  various celebrities and idols.} the majority of Toranomon News' hosts,
including Kent Gilbert and the Chinese born Shi Ping (Seki Hei), have
previously capitalized and continue to do so on a print-medium market
for historical revisionist and nationalist `Japan as Number One'
literature and literature highly critical of China and South
Korea.\footnote{Although there is a market for counter-argumentative
  literature as well. On April 6, 2019 a book with the following eye-catching
  title was published under Martin Fackler's name, the journalist with whom
  this paper opened: ``Precisely because I'm an American journalist is
  Japan's national disaster transparent'' (\emph{Beikoku hito
  jānarisutodakara minuketa Nihon no kokunan}
  『米国人ジャーナリストだから見抜けた日本の国難』 ). It's subtitle:
  ``The truth of this country that the media does not report''
  (\emph{media ga hontō no koto o tsutaenai kono kuni no shinjitsu}
  「メディアが本当のことを伝えないこの国の真実」).} Since 2015 they have
joined hands to influence public opinion and target the market for
nationalist rhetoric online, with YouTuber and imperial descendant
Takeda Tsuneyasu on the panel and YouTuber Kazuya as frequent guest (the
latter seen amongst the top Niconico videos back in chapter two in
\textbf{figure \ref{fig:nicotop}} and as an interviewee in the
Japanism magazine in \textbf{figure \ref{fig:japanism4}}). Other guests
include Abe Shinzō himself,\footnote{As Arimoto Kaori herself describes
  in an article on the \emph{Sankei shinbun} tabloid \emph{Yūkanfuji}
  (夕刊フジ), On the July 13, 2019 edition of the annual cherry blossom
  viewing party (\emph{sakura o mirukai} 「桜を見る会」), Abe Shinzō was
  again seen in the company of various Toranomon News regulars including
  Arimoto Kaori, Hyakuta Naoki, Kent Gilbert, Takeda Kunihiko, Jōnen
  Tsukasa, Suda Shin'ichirō, Takeda Tsuneyasu, Fujii Genki and Ōtaka
  miki (Arimoto \protect\hyperlink{ref-arimoto_eng._2019}{2019}).} as
well as former Minister of Internal Affairs and Communications Yoshitaka
Shindō, various LDP lawmakers including Mio Sugita, \emph{Nippon Kaigi}
associate Sakurai Yoshiko and former idol Chiba Reiko.\footnote{Many of
  the above have contributed to the magazine Japanism as well. Volume 24
  (September 16, 2015), for example, includes writings by Kent Gilbert,
  Sugita Mio, Sakurai Makoto, Kurayama Mitsuru, while Volume 49 (June 8,
  2019) includes writings by Kazuya, Chiba Reiko and again Sugita Mio.}

Hyakuta Naoki, regular commentator on Toranomon News and author of the
best-selling 2006 war drama ``The Eternal Zero'' (which in its 2013
screen-adaption won the Japan Academy Prize for best film) went on to
co-author \emph{nihon yo, sekai no man'naka de sakihokore}
(『日本よ、世界の真ん中で咲き誇れ』, ``Japan! Be Proud of Yourself in
the Center of the World!'') with Abe Shinzō in 2013 and was appointed by
the latter as board of governor member of Japan's national broadcast
service NHK in 2013.\footnote{Abe gained further criticism with his
  appointment of ``comfort women'' apologist Katsuto Momii as chairman
  of NHK, in what the \emph{Japan Times} described as a ``trend toward
  self-censorship'' (Sieg
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-sieg_under_2015}{2015}).} Although his November
2018 bestseller \emph{Nihon Kokuki} (日本国紀, `Chronicle of Japan') was
criticized for historical revisionism and plagiarism from Wikipedia
(Yamamoto \protect\hyperlink{ref-yamamoto__2018}{2018}), he subsequently
followed up with the March 2019 \emph{Ima koso, Kankoku ni ayamarō
\textasciitilde{} soshite,`saraba' to iō \textasciitilde{}}
(『今こそ、韓国に謝ろう ～そして、「さらば」と言おう～』, ``Then let us
now apologize to South Korea-and say, `Farewell'\,'').

Takeda Tsuneyasu is not without controversy either, posting, for
example, the following Tweet on May 22, 2016, enforcing stereotypes of
violent crimes linked to foreigners (Takeda
\protect\hyperlink{ref-takeda_eng._2016}{2016}):

\begin{quote}
「小金井ライブハウス殺人未遂事件で逮捕された人物は「自称・岩埼友宏容疑者」と報道されている。自称ということは本名でないということ。なぜ本名で報道しない？ここが日本のメディアのおかしいところ。臆する必要はない。本名で報道すべき。これは私の憶測だが、容疑者は日本国籍ではないと思われる。」
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
``\emph{Koganei raibuhausu satsujin misui jiken de taiho sa reta

\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
``The person arrested for the Koganei Live House murder attempt is
reported as the `self-proclaimed' Tomohiro Iwasaki. `Self-proclaimed'
means it is not a real name. Why not report their real name? This is
strange of the Japanese media. There is no need to be hesitant. The
media should report it under their real name. This is my speculation,
but the suspect seems not to be of Japanese nationality.''

Some have embraced the Netto-Uyoku phrasing, such as YouTuber Fuji Genki
(see \textbf{Figure \ref{fig:genkifuji}}), who with 14,900 subscribers
on his main account has published videos both in English and Japanese on
accounts as Yamatotube2, \emph{Chan'neru kura-ra} チャンネルくらら and
\emph{hoshu ronkaku chan'neru+} 保守論客チャンネル+ (lit. `Conservative
Polemicist Channel+'). A conservative online voice, he has referred to
himself tongue-in-cheek as \emph{nekouyo} ネコウヨ (a wordplay literally
meaning `cat-right' as opposite to `net-right'). Of note is the English
language antagonizing both Chinese imperialists and Japanese leftists as
anti-Japanese elements, and the literal translation ``Japan You Don't
Know'' (most likely from the common rhetorical device \emph{anata no
shiranai nihon} 「あなたの知らない日本」), implying a \emph{real} Japan
hidden by the mainstream press.

Whereas the software the Japanese 2channel and English 4chan are based
on were influential in shaping online communities throughout the late
'90s and early '00s, the software Wikipedia (a free online encyclopedia
based on transparent and open collaboration) runs on, MediaWiki, has
since its inception in 2002 gained much traction worldwide. Uses range
from the political realm\footnote{Governmental instances in the United
  States use the software as a content management system for internal
  information sharing (Diplopedia and Intellipedia), for example.
  WikiLeaks, famous for publishing various sensitive documents, was
  originally built on this software as well.} to lighter
topics,\footnote{Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales founded \emph{Fandom},
  a for-profit variant of MediaWiki, specifically for in-depth pages on
  popular culture topics.} and Wiki-style sub-communities are build
around every possible aspect of popular culture.\footnote{There are, for
  example, numerous Japanese Wiki-style outlets solely on the topic of
  AKB48's idol formations, with \url{https://48pedia.org} (as of July 12, 2019) alone already containing 2,062 pages.} Wikipedia itself is
as of 2019 the \nth{5} most visited website in the world and \nth{6}
most in Japan; with 7 percent of all articles being written in Japanese
(the \nth{2} most represented language on Wikipedia). The specific
mannerisms of utilizing Wikipedia have formed distinct subcultures and
group dynamics, and vandalism or so-called \emph{edit-wars} (disputes
over content through reverting and adjusting user contributions) are not
uncommon elements of those. The open nature of Wikipedia and its
underlying MediaWiki software permits us a glimpse into topics that
Wikipedia editors place high importance on.

Drawing on a copy of the meta-data of the Japanese Wikipedia's database,
\textbf{Table \ref{tab:50mostcont}}\footnote{This is a translation. For
  an elaboration on the employed methodology, as well as the original,
  slightly more expanded list, see section \ref{sec:wikiappendix} and
  \textbf{table \ref{tab:50expanded}} (page \pageref{tab:50expanded}).}
displays the top fifty most `contentious' articles on the Japanese
Wikipedia as of 2019 (in other words, articles that have high rates of
such \emph{edit-warring}, based on the amount of reverts done in
contrast to the total amount of edits).\footnote{As of 2019, the article
  with the highest rate of reverts in contrast to its rate of revisions
  is the topic of Japanese war crimes in Nanjing during the Second
  Sino-Japanese War. This paper follows the English designations as used
  by Wikipedia. \emph{Nankin jiken} 南京事件 is therefore not translated
  as Nanjing Incident but as Nanjing Massacre instead.} We find that regardless whether these statistics are sorted by
total revisions, total reverts or total `contention', the lists of
Wikipedia articles are dominated almost entirely with articles devoted
to Japanese idol pop-artists (in particular AKB48) and animation
(specifically One Piece). Sorted on either total reverts or total
contention these lists include throughout the years topics such as Abe
Shinzō, Japan, Sōka Gakkai, the Nanjing Massacre, Netto-Uyoku, both
South and North Korea, and Zainichi Koreans. Throughout other years,
this list has included topics such as the South Korean figure skater
Yuna Kim,\footnote{In the wake of Yuna Kim's victory over the Japanese
  skater Mao Asada during the 2010 Winter Olympics, rumors were spread
  on 2channel over a supposed improper win (CNN
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-cnn_korean_2010}{2010}).} the topic of male
discrimination (\emph{dansei sabetsu} 男性差別), an article on a
supposed \emph{Korean origin theory} (\emph{kankoku kigen-setsu}
韓国起源説), global warming, Ishihara Shintarō, Hashimoto Tōru and the
former Prime Ministers Asō Tarō, Hatoyama Yukio, Kan Naoto and Koizumi
Jun'ichirō.

Of immediate note are 1. the position of Netto-Uyoku as \nth{2} most
contentious article (already implying that Netto-Uyoku are highly active
on Wikipedia), and 2. a seemingly distinct lack of articles that would
otherwise be considered controversial topics, such as the territorial
disputes of the Liancourt Rocks. Administrators do, however, have the
ability to `protect' articles from anonymous edits (or even any edit in
general) until new information comes up. That being said, on a platform
that is dominated by articles on pop-culture when viewed over large time
lapses, a closer look at top edits per month does reflect topical
events. As the Liancourt Rock dispute gained renewed traction, so did that particular
Japanese article, for example, reach first spot
as the most edited article of August 2012. Moreover, so did between May
and June 2006 various other articles related to Netto-Uyoku sentiment
reach first or otherwise high spots.\footnote{in order the following
  articles all reached top revisions for those months:
  `\emph{Anti-Korean sentiment}' (\emph{kenkan}, 嫌韓),
  `\emph{Zchannel}' (2ちゃんねる), `\emph{South Korea}'
  (\emph{daikanminkoku}, 大韓民国), `\emph{The Women's International War
  Crimes Tribunal on Japan's Military Sexual Slavery}' (\emph{josei
  kokusai senpan hōtei}, 女性国際戦犯法廷), `\emph{Japan--Korea
  disputes}' (\emph{nikkanmondai}, 日韓問題), `\emph{minority
  discrimination}' (\emph{minzoku sabetsu}, 民族差別),
  `\emph{Anti-Japanese Sentiment}' (\emph{han'nichi}, 反日),
  `\emph{ishihara shintarō}' (石原慎太郎), `\emph{Right of foreigners to
  vote}' (\emph{gaikokuninjinseiken}, 外国人参政権), `\emph{Special
  Privileges of the Zainichi}' (\emph{zainichi tokken}, 在日特権).}

During the early 2000s when articles on common topics were still being
written from the ground up, reverts were uncommon to the point that they
are not a reliable way to express quantifiable controversy in this time.
Based on the total amount of revisions as an indicator of perceived
importance by the Japanese Wikipedia community, top articles in the
early days of the Japanese Wikipedia contain, however, few articles
related to such pop culture phenomena. Instead in 2003 the most revised
articles include the topics of the Japanese railway,\footnote{Such as
  \emph{`List of railway stations in Japan'} (\emph{Nihon no tetsudō-eki
  ichiran}, 日本の鉄道駅一覧), \emph{`List of railway lines in Japan'}
  (\emph{Nihon no tetsudō rosen ichiran}, 日本の鉄道路線一覧),
  \emph{`Tokyo Express Railway'} (\emph{tōkyōkyūkōdentetsu},
  東京急行電鉄) and \emph{`Japanese National Railway 113-series Trains'}
  (\emph{kokutetsu 113-kei densha}, 国鉄113系電車). High interest in
  railways and trains (\emph{tetsudō otaku} 鉄道オタク or \emph{densha
  otaku} 電車オタク) is not an uncommon phenomenon.} religion\footnote{\emph{`Christian
  glossary'} (\emph{kirisutokyō yōgo ichiran} キリスト教用語一覧),
  \emph{Catholicism} (\emph{katorishizumu}, カトリシズム),
  \emph{`Christianity'} (\emph{kirisutokyō}, キリスト教), \emph{`List of
  Gods'} (\emph{kami no ichiran}, 神の一覧) and \emph{`Religion'}
  (\emph{shūkyō}, 宗教)} as well as topics related to China\footnote{\emph{`China'}
  (\emph{chūgoku}, 中国), \emph{`Taiwan'} (台湾), \emph{`List of Chinese
  Emperors' } (\emph{chūgoku teiō ichiran}, 中国帝王一覧)} and Japanese
history.\footnote{\emph{`World War II'} (\emph{dainijisekaitaisen},
  第二次世界大戦), \emph{`Pacific War'} (\emph{taiheiyōsensō},
  太平洋戦争), \emph{`Japanese History'} (\emph{Nihon'norekishi},
  日本の歴史)} In 2004 2channel joins the top of this list as second
most revised article, alongside articles related to
media-channels\footnote{\emph{`Fuji Television'} (\emph{Fuji terebijon},
  フジテレビジョン), \emph{`Nippon Television Broadcasting Network'}
  (\emph{nihon terebi hōsōmō}, 日本テレビ放送網), \emph{`TV TOKYO'}
  (\emph{terebi tōkyō}, テレビ東京), Mainichi Broadcasting
  (\emph{mainichi hōsō}, 毎日放送), \emph{`Tokyo Broadcasting Holdings'}
  (\emph{tōkyōhōsō hōrudingusu}, 東京放送ホールディングス), \emph{`Japan
  Broadcasting Association'} (\emph{nihon hōsō kyōkai}, 日本放送協会),
  \emph{`Chubu Nippon Broadcasting'} (\emph{chūbu nippon hōsō},
  中部日本放送), \emph{`Nippon Broadcasting'} (\emph{nippon hōsō},
  ニッポン放送), \emph{`Asahi Broadcasting Group Holdings'}
  (\emph{asahihōsō gurūpu hōrudingusu} 朝日放送グループホールディングス)}
and the Korean peninsula. It is only from 2005 onwards that we perceive
an increase of mass-edited articles on pop-media (animation as
\emph{crayon shin-chan} クレヨンしんちゃん, \emph{doraemon} ドラえもん,
One Piece and Naruto reach the top of this list). Although this rate has
decreased over the years, the rate of anonymous edits on the Japanese
Wikipedia is still remarkably high when contrasted to the global scale;
an indication of 2channel's \emph{modus operandi} seeping into Wikipedia
(see \textbf{figure \ref{fig:anon-wiki}}). Although anonymity is to be
taken with a grain of salt, considering IP addresses are publicly
available, of note here is particularly the intent of the user not to be
associated with a user-name.

\end{figure}

Using the statistic tool-set \emph{XTools},\footnote{An open-source
  tool-set building on the Wiki-media API, available at
  \url{https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/XTools}.} one gets further
insights into the revision history of each article, as well as into the
Wikipedia users contributing to them. An overview of revision statistics
on two contested topics (see \textbf{figures \ref{fig:xtools-zainichi}
and \ref{fig:xtools-asahi}}) shows a sharp increase of activity in the
period of 2009-11, an increase that cannot be explained solely by a rise
in usage of Wikipedia as a platform but falls in line with the
aforementioned increase of interest in right-wing politics (see
\textbf{figure \ref{fig:politictrends}}) and Netto-Uyoku (\textbf{figure
\ref{fig:nettouyoku}}). This is confirmed by the relative word count to
the amount of edits, which is aside, aside from the 2011 peak in edits
of \textbf{figures \ref{fig:xtools-zainichi}}, not in proportion and
indicates again the contentious character of the topic on Wikipedia.

The article on Netto-Uyoku, then, has seen 2,281 edits by 756 users since
its creation on September 30, 2005 with an anonymous revision:

in the Suginawa protests on the adoption of a new school textbook with
2channel-themed placards.''\footnote{This refers to an event in 2005,
  \emph{Suginami-ku rekishi kyōkasho saitaku sōdō}
  (杉並区歴史教科書採択騒動, ``Suginami Ward history textbook adoption
  riot'') wherein groups both agreeing with and protesting the adoption
  of a new history schoolbook for public education (which would lessen
  the focus on topics deemed masochistic) took to the Suginawa Ward in
  Tokyo for public protest. 2channel users in particular protested
  supposed ties of protesters with the New Left (in particular the
  Revolutionary Communist League, National Committee or Chūkaku-ha).}
\end{quote}

Since then the article has grown to contain 70,744 characters and is
linked to from other pages 405 times, an indication of the term steadily
seeping into public discourse. As shown in \textbf{table
\ref{tab:50mostcont}}, the topic remains controversial amongst certain
users. The very last edits in our data-source (and thus the most recent
at July 2, 2019) are the following addition and its subsequent
revert:\footnote{A user whose further edits include the addition
  \emph{Nihonjin ni keizai hoshō to shazai o shita ue de horobirubeki
  kokkadearu}
  (「日本人に経済保証と謝罪をした上で滅びるべき国家である。」, lit. ``A
  nation that after giving economic guarantees and apologies to the
  Japanese people, ought to be destroyed''), to the Japanese article of
  `\emph{South Korea}' and some vandalism to the article of South Korean
  idol formation TWICE. Edits to that article include amongst others
  changing Japanese member 名井 南 (Myōi Mina) to \emph{han-nichi,
  baikoku-yatsu} (「反日、売国奴」, `anti-Japanese, traitorous bastard')
  and later \emph{uragirimono no Nihonjin} (「 裏切り者の日本人」,
  `traitorous Japanese').}

\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
``These are wonderful people who do not spare time in order to restore
Japan and making it the brightest country in the world. To that end,
they takes the initiative of legitimating ethnic discrimination by
Japanese people.''
\end{quote}

Here, the phrasing of `restoring Japan' envokes images of an idealized
`\emph{fantasy} Japan' and is eerily similar to prime minister Abe's
political catch-phrase \emph{nippon o torimodosu} (
「日本を、取り戻す。」, `We will restore Japan'), used during his
political campaign against the DPJ in the wake of the 2011 earthquake.
As is what we translated as `brightest country' similar to prime
minister Abe's \emph{Utsukushii kuni he} (『美しい国へ』, `Toward a
Beautiful Nation'). The initially vague expressions of `restoring' (from
what?) and `bright' or `beautiful' country (defined how?) are implicitly
answered by this user: normalization of ethnic discrimination is a means
to restore Japan (from ethnic minorities) and make it a bright
(ethnically homogeneous) country.

A constant in these contested pages are large contributions by a small
group of people. The top contributor to the article of \emph{Nanking
Massacre} (27.7 percent of all edits, between the period of November 1,
2009 and April 16, 2019), for example, is a user by the handle of
\emph{yamato-yashiki} (大和屋敷). This is a user with as of July 2, 2019
16,682 edits over 3,229 pages including 139 edits to English Wikipedia
articles (where this user has since been blocked from contributing, having
focused primarily on topics related to Korea, such as `Korean
Nationalism' and the `Japan-Korea Treaty of 1910', as well as `softer'
topics as \emph{otaku}, \emph{Yakiniku} and `Secret photography').
Moreover, this user is amongst the top editors (based on frequency of
personal edits compared to total edits) for other such contested topics
as \emph{Netto-Uyoku} (first place with 19.7 percent). The second
largest contributor to this article (with 166 or 15.7 percent edits
between October 21, 2015 and March 17, 2019) is `Japanese Sincerity',
which is a twin-account of the since blocked account `Japanese spirits'
(and most likely a reference to \emph{yamato-damashii} 大和魂, a
normative expression of \emph{nihonjinron}-style Japanese
ethno-nationalism). A look at the profile page of `Japanese Sincerity'
on Wikipedia reveals the following information:

\begin{quote}

\end{figure}

Contrary to that statement, the topics of choice and their particular
edits do reveal an ideological point of view. Of note are this user's
455 contributions to the English language Wikipedia, as well as several
to the Spanish (46) and French Wikipedia (28), dominantly on topics of
Japanese war crimes. As shown in \textbf{\ref{fig:js-abe} and
\ref{fig:js-inada}}, through the now banned twin-account of `Japanese
spirits' this user has formerly contributed to English articles on Inada
Tomomi\footnote{Japanese lawyer Inada Tomomi served under Abe Shinzō as
  Minister of Defense and Minister in charge of the Cool Japan Strategy.
  She has made controversial statements regarding stock elements of
  Japanese nationalism, such as partly denying the Nanking Massacre and
  the Comfort Women system and stating that there is no need to
  continuing expression of remorse towards other Asian countries.} and
Abe Shinzō with apologetic, reactionary edits (the former which are as
of July 9, 2019 still largely in-tact). Support for the revisionist
agenda of Nippon Kaigi is in this user's logic an act of honor and
patriotism. Criticism of the Yasukuni Shrine too is disrespectful
towards ``the souls of dead Japanese soldiers'' and, furthermore, the
2017 critical documentary \emph{Yasukuni} betrayed a Chinese tinted
political agenda. Amongst this user's referenced sources we find
``Japanese Magazine `Will'\,'', a website Tsuji
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-tsuji_eng:_2008}{2008}) links as primary news
source for Netto-Uyoku. Through their main account `Japanese Sincerity',
this user has since opted for a softer tone. Their last contribution, on
the article for `Pantingan River massacre' (which too is still largely
intact as of July 9, 2019), attempts to downplay events with the
following line:

\begin{quote}
``Following Tsuji's abnormal order which was considered to be a war
criminal and beyond his commission, Japanese 122 Regiment of Sixty-fifth
Brigade executed the US and Philippine soldiers in the Pantingan River
{[}2{]}. Colonel Takeo Imai, of another Japanese regiment, was doubt the
authority of the order which came from the top but not clearly from who?
and Imai ignored the cruel order and did not any execusion{[}3{]}
(\emph{sic}).''

Another prolific Wikipedia user (and contributor to the \emph{Nanking
Massacre} article with 10.5 percent of its edits done between December
3, 2009 and April 30, 2019) is the user `\emph{kachō fūgetsu
setsugetsuka keibu}' (`花蝶風月雪月花警部').\footnote{The origin of the
  name is unclear but possibly refers to a poem. \emph{kachō fūgetsu}
  花蝶風月 translates as  ``Beauty of Flowers and Butterflies'' or ``Blossoms and butterflies,
  the cool breeze and a bright moon.'' \emph{setsu gekka} 雪月花 refers
  to an ancient Chinese poem (attributed to Bai Juyi) and is a common
  theme amongst ukiyo-e artists, translating as ``Snow, Moon and
  Flowers.'' \emph{keibu} 警部, then, means ``police force'' and
  possible refers to the user's role as an administrator or supervisor
  on Wikipedia.} The actions of this user however involve policing
primarily un-sourced or biased edits, and an online search of this
account reveals several topics accusing that user of being an
`Anti-Japanese leftist traitor' (\emph{han-nichi baikoku sayoku}
反日売国サヨク) and an ethnic Korean (\emph{zainichi chōsenjin}
在日朝鮮人) (osakaichibanyane

\protect\hyperlink{ref-anonymous_cant_2017}{2017}\protect\hyperlink{ref-anonymous_cant_2017}{a}).
One other such active user, `JapaneseA' (2,655 pages created and 46,343
pages edited) has received similar critique (Yahoo.co.jp
\protect\hyperlink{ref-anonymous_japanesea_2017}{2017}\protect\hyperlink{ref-anonymous_japanesea_2017}{b}).
Their policing conflicts have led to bans of active editors such as
`Chichiii', who has added 11,999 edits to 3,926 articles and authored
572 articles including \emph{Emperor Apologize request by Korea}
(\emph{Kankoku ni yoru ten'nō shazai yōkyū} 韓国による天皇謝罪要求),
\emph{Foreign Regional Suffrage} (\emph{gaikokujin chihō sansei-ken}
外国人地方参政権) and \emph{The issue of the Chinese Embassy and Primary
land acquisition in Tokyo} (\emph{chūgoku taishikan tonai ittōchi baishū
mondai} 中国大使館都内一等地買収問題).\footnote{A MediaWiki-based
  2channel aggregation (\emph{matome}) page,
  2ちゃんねるウィキペディアスレまとめwiki (\emph{2-channeru wikipedia
  sure matome wikki}, `2channel Wikipedia tread aggregation Wiki')
  contains entries on various of the aforementioned Wikipedia editors.
  The entry on `Chichiii' in particular states ``Joined with an account
  in 2008. A typical neto-uyo, this user happily writes revisions
  whenever Zainichi Koreans have cause some kind of incident''
  (\emph{``2008-Nen kara akaunto de sanka. Tenkei-tekina neto-uyodeari,

If we take a look at some of the other contested articles, similar
trends arise. Going through the revision history of articles as
\emph{`Japan'} (\emph{`nihon'}, 日本), \emph{`Hatoyama Yukio'}
(鳩山由紀夫), \emph{`Foreign suffrage in Japan'} (\emph{Nihon ni okeru
gaikokujin sanseiken}, 日本における外国人参政権), \emph{`Zainichi
Koreans'} (\emph{zainichi kankoku・chōsenjin} 在日韓国・朝鮮人),
\emph{`Asahi shinbun'} (朝日新聞) and \emph{`Zaitokukai'} reveals
primarily edits by `Chichiii', \emph{`kachō fūgetsu setsugetsuka keibu'}
(`花蝶風月雪月花警部' and `\emph{yamato yashiki}'
(`大和屋敷').\footnote{Going through the article on \emph{Zaitokukai} in
  particular reveals a large portion of blocked accounts, including for
  example contributor \emph{Asahara Shoko} 麻原彰晃, a reference to Aum
  Shinrikyo founder Asahara Shoko.} Another top contributor with a
telling user name to that latter article is the user \emph{`takeshima wa
nihon'} (`竹島は日本', translated as `Takeshima is Japanese'), who has
also contributed to articles related to 2channel,\footnote{In particular
  the topics \emph{`2channeler'} (\emph{2-channerā}, 2ちゃんねらー),
  \emph{`List of 2channel boards'} (\emph{2-channeru no ita no ichiran},
  2ちゃんねるの板の一覧) and `\emph{news bulletin (VIP) + board}'
  (\emph{nyūsu sokuhō (VIP) + ita}, ニュース速報(VIP)+板).} Baseball
star Suzuki Ichirō (popularly referred to as \emph{Ichirō}, イチロー)
and the Wikipedia article on Makoto Sakurai.

One aspect of personalization on Wikipedia is the usage of badges on
one's profile.\footnote{For a full list of such badges, see Wikipedia
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-anonymous_wikipedia:_2019}{2019}).}
Take, for example, user `S.S.Exp.Hashimoto'; a user primarily active on
railway-related articles but just as well a top contributor to the
articles \emph{`Netto-Uyoku'}, \emph{`Taiwan'} and \emph{`Foreign
suffrage in Japan'} (with a total of 4,698 pages edited between February
28, 2004 and July 6, 2019, including several on the English Wikipedia).
The user-page includes some information on the user's interest in
railways (the handle itself is a reference to the Keio Line semi-express
train towards Hashimoto, Kanagawa prefecture) and 2channel. More
interesting is however this user's usage of badges, as illustrated on
\textbf{figure \ref{fig:hashimoto}}. Badges that should be pointed out
are not uncommon, as seen on the profile of a top contributor to the
article on \emph{`asahi shinbun'}, user \emph{`gokoku bōkyō-dan'}
(`護国防共団', lit. `anti-communist national defense corps') and article
\emph{Taiwan} top editor `Kamakura' (who between August 19, 2003 and
June 30, 2019 had made 7,616 edits to over 3,933 articles, including 315
edits on the English wikipedia). This is illustrated on respectively
\textbf{figure \ref{fig:defense-corps}} and \textbf{figure
\ref{fig:kamakura}}.

In all three cases, the users express support for the Self Defense Force
(SDF). `S.S.Exp.Hashimoto' and `Kamakura' both take pride in their
identity as 2channel users,\footnote{The catchphrase used on that
  particular badge (\emph{Kono riyōsha wa 2-channerā desugananika?},
  「この利用者は2ちゃんねらーですが何か?」) translates as a rhetorical
  question expressing indifference, ``This user is a 2channel-user, so
  what?''} both have Shintoist beliefs and both express their support
for nuclear energy. `S.S.Exp.Hashimoto' and \emph{`gokoku bōkyō-dan'}
(`護国防共団') then both describe themselves as conservative.
\emph{gokoku bōkyō-dan} (護国防共団) and `Kamakura' show their support
for the Emperor System and the LDP. User \emph{gokoku bōkyō-dan}
(護国防共団) takes pride in being Japanese, shows support for the
ultra-conservative Nippon Kaigi, political visits to the Yasukuni Shrine
and the LDP. `S.S.Exp.Hashimoto' expresses a dislike towards Mainland
China and communism, while simultaneously expressing love for Taiwan (as
documented earlier, a Wikipedia topic this user is affiliated with) and
the United States. Finally, `Kamakura' has further syncretic tendencies
expressing belief in both Taoism and Buddhism, and furthermore expresses
support for the death penalty.

The hyper-linked design of the MediaWiki software, reflecting on Azuma
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-azuma_otaku:_2001}{2001}) and Manovich
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-manovich_software_2013}{2013}), offers
previously unseen ways of global interconnection by linking articles
between the different language variants of Wikipedia. This has political
consequences as well. We have already shown the tendency of editing
articles on non-Japanese Wikipedia variants (primarily the English
variant) by several users depicting tropes common to the Netto-Uyoku.
Whereas the English article\footnote{The page was created on June 1, 2016
  with the most recent revision made on July 17, 2019.} portrays
Netto-Uyoku as ``Japanese neo-nationalists who interact almost entirely
within their own cyber community, shut off from the rest of Japanese
society'' and who ``first appeared on the Internet during the Lost
Decade, which was an economic crisis in Japan from the 1990s to 2010s''
(perpetuating the idea of Netto-Uyoku as a disenfranchised by-product of
the Lost Decade), on November 11, 2018 a user by the name of `Normal
Japanese' replaced the page contents with ``anti-Japanese left wings
will perish'' (which was reverted one minute afterwards). The normative
framing of oneself as ``normal Japanese,'' representing the general will
of the Japanese people, is a common red line throughout Netto-Uyoku
rhetoric, as is the usage of ``anti-Japanese left wings'' (a direct
translation of \emph{han'nichi sayoku}, 反日左翼) and `perish'
(\emph{shine}, 死ね) as aggressive verbal attack.\footnote{Adachi
  Yasushi (a House of Representatives member and Deputy Secretary
  General of Japan Innovation Party) for example, tweeted on 11 Nov 2017
  \emph{asahi shinbun, shine} (「朝日新聞、死ね。」, lit. ``Asahi
  Shinbun, die.''), which has since gained traction on Twitter with the
  hashtag ``\#朝日新聞死ね'' (Adachi
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-adachi_eng._2017}{2017}).}

With heated tensions between Japanese and South Korean nationalists, it
is not unexpected to find traces of struggles online and particularly on Wikipedia
either (as suggested by \textbf{figures \ref{fig:netto-altright}} and
\textbf{\ref{fig:netto-altright-kor}}). Although the page on Zaitokukai
has variants in different languages, the article on the umbrella term
for such ACM organizations is available
only on the Japanese and Korean Wikipedia. As another example of utilizing
interlinking articles for nationalist purposes, a large-scale DDoS
(cyber-)attack on 2channel's servers occurring on March 1, 2010 has an
article in Japanese (\emph{Kangokujin ni yoru 2-chan neru e no saibātero
jiken} `韓国人による2ちゃんねるへのサイバーテロ事件') and Korean
(\emph{2010nyeon han·il sam-iljeol saibeo gong-gyeog sageon}, `2010년
한·일 삼일절 사이버 공격 사건'). An English variant (`2010 Japan--South
Korea cyber-warfare') was created on December 24, 2014, fours years after
the initial event, by a Korean-speaking user.\footnote{The English
  variant was created by user `Kanghuitari' (who has between April 29,
  2012 and July 11, 2019 contributed 27,984 edits on the English
  Wikipedia page and 28,411 edits on the Korean Wikipedia).} Translated
to English, the Japanese title of the page is more akin to ``the
cyber-terror incident on 2channel by South Koreans,'' referencing terrorism as an ideologically motivated attack. The Korean
title, instead, translates to ``The 2010 South Korea-Japan 3-1
cyber-attack,'' with 3-1 (\emph{sam-iljeol}, 삼일절) as reference to the Korean March \nth{1} Movement in 1919.

Another common aspect of Wikipedia are lists or categories with
personally identified correlations. Take for example the categories
`Anti-Japanese sentiment in South Korea' (containing 61 pages), its
Japanese equivalent \emph{Kankoku no han'nichi kanjō} 韓国の反日感情 (56
articles) and its Korean equivalent \emph{daehanmingug-ui ban-il
gamjeong} `대한민국의 반일 감정' (80 articles). The English page has an
additional ``See also: Category:Anti-Korean sentiment in Japan.'' tag
that is present neither on the Japanese nor Korean variants.\footnote{There
  are however equivalents for that category on both the Korean Wikipedia
  (\emph{ilbon-ui banhan gamjeong} 일본의 반한 감정, with 23 items) and
  the Japanese Wikipedia (\emph{hankan kanjō} 反韓感情, lit.
  \emph{`anti-Korean sentiment'} and \emph{hanchō kanjō} 反朝感情, lit
  \emph{`anti-South Korean sentiment'}, containing respectively 4 and 18
  items).} That latter category, Anti-Korean sentiment in Japan, then
contains 33 articles (including a link to 2channel), with edits made to
primarily by users who have expressed South Korean identity or interest
into South Korea in their user-pages (such as the user `Caspian
blue'\footnote{This user appears to be Swedish but contributions are
  almost exclusively on Korean cultural or historical aspects.}).
Between April and July 2019‎, an anonymous user made additions to
several pages such as Japanese idol Chiba Reiko\footnote{Since 2016
  frequent Toranomon News guest Chiba Reiko did publish various works on
  the topic, such as the 2016 ``\emph{Sayonara payoku — chibarei ga mita
  sayoku no jittai}'' 『さよならパヨク---チバレイが見た左翼の実態---』
  (lit. ``Farewell Payoku-The Actual Condition of the Left Wing As Seen
  by Chiba-Rei'') and the collaboration with Zaitokukai-founder Makoto
  Sakurai ``\emph{kutabare payoku}'' (『くたばれパヨク』, lit. ``Drop
  dead \emph{payoku}''), as well as the 2017 ``\emph{mama ha aikoku}''
  (『ママは愛国』, lit. ``Mommy is a patriot'') with prolific right-wing
  author Kurayama Mitsuru and \emph{``kanashī sayoku ni goyōshin!''}
  (『悲しいサヨクにご用心!』, lit. ``Beware of the sad left-wingers'')
  with Kurayama Mitsuru and LDP lawmaker Mio Sugita.} and film director
and comedian Kitano Takeshi, including the Wiki-syntax formatted
reference `{[}{[}Category:Anti-Korean sentiment in Japan{]}{]}'. As of
July 2019 Kitano Takeshi is still listed as belonging to this category,
although neither the English nor Japanese variant contain mentions of
anti-Korean sentiment either on the main document or in prior
revisions.\footnote{Rumors of Takeshi Kitano having either anti-Korean
  sentiment or being ethnically Korean were renewed in
  2018 after a South Korean idol reportedly came under fire for posting
  on social media a gift he received from the film-maker. The Korea
  Times erroneously reported `anti-Korean Japanese filmmaker Kitano
  Takeshi' as having co-authored a book on the Senkaku Islands with
  Ishihara Shintarō in the early 2000s (Dong
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-dong_ikon_2018}{2018}), which was echoed by
  British outlet Metro (Hicap
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-hicap_ikons_2018}{2018}).}

The revision pages of those pages too confirm what this chapter has thus
far demonstrated. Users are trying to influence public perception on
sensitive topics both regionally and internationally. Of note here is
the user \emph{`ao-oniyoshi'} (`青鬼よし'), with 7,662 edits on 2,192
articles between February 22, 2009 and July 9, 2019 and a top editor on
the Japanese article for `\emph{Hatoyama Yukio}' and `\emph{March
\nth{1} Movement}'. This user's edits include 577 edits on the English
Wikipedia, focusing primarily on the article for `Kofun period' (87),
`Japan--Korea disputes' (30) and `Korea under Japanese rule' (15) before
this account on the English Wikipedia was locked.\footnote{On the
  Japanese alternative MediaWiki website \emph{ja.yourpedia.org}, this
  is user is described in a dedicated page as \emph{neto-uyo-pedian}
  (「ネトウヨペディアン」).} Since then, a `Category:Suspected Wikipedia
sockpuppets of Azukimonaka' lists \emph{`ao-oniyoshi'} (`青鬼よし') as
one of 25 double accounts of one suspected user contributing edits to
controversial topics on Korean and Japanese history. Amongst the other
users in this list are the user `KoreanShoriSenyou' (which when written
in Japanese characters could refer to the account as intended
exclusively or possibly combatively for disposal or procession of
anything Korean-related, コリアン処理専用 or コリアン処理戦用) and
Azukimonaka (whose top edits include pages on `Eugenics in Japan',
`Foreign relations of South Korea', `Japanese expansionism' and `Manga',
as well as on the category of `Anti-Japanese sentiment in Korea').

\section{\texorpdfstring{Online Grassroots counter-Activism: `Ban
Matsuri'}{Online Grassroots counter-Activism: Ban Matsuri}}\label{online-grassroots-counter-activism-ban-matsuri}

As demonstrated in the previous chapters, the world wide web and social
media platforms are increasingly relevant tools for shifting public
opinion. Moreover, this is done from the ideologically populist stance
that these media---\emph{bottom-up} media lacking so-called
gatekeepers---represent the people's will. In other words, an online
public sphere on which counter-hegemonic ideologies can develop and seep
into civil society. This chapter further demonstrated several attempts
to steer public opinion by those who reside in 2channel's most active
echo-chambers. This was done on an active level by using widespread
tools as Wikipedia, but also passively through reinforcement of what is
framed as the people's voice on \emph{matome} aggregation websites.
Those aggregation websites should be noted for being profit-driven and
acting on a demand of (such-framed) \emph{Japan-bashing}.

The consumption of `anti-Japan' news serves discursive processes of
nationalist self-socialization through an antagonistic `Othering', to
rely on post-colonial theory. In other words, a construction of the self
as being both morally superior to the irrationality of the dehumanized
Other (positive self-presentation), but also as the \emph{real} victim
of a greater anti-Japanese conspiracy driven by the 'leftist elites', mainstream news and an imagined foreign enemy. This is
further framed in a cynicism adherent to these cyber-communities.
Alongside the blogs already mentioned, can the latter be deduced from
the mere names of certain aggregation blogs and channels: `Kimchi
Newsflash' (\emph{kimuchi sokuhō} 「キムチ速報」), `Traitor Newsflash'
(\emph{baikoku sokuhō}, 「売国速報(\^{}ω\^{})」), `Funny Anti-Japan
Channel' (\emph{omoshiro han'nichi chan'neru}
「おもしろ反日チャンネル」), `Zainichi Korean Crime Newsflash'
(\emph{zainichi hanzai sokuhō}, 「在日犯罪速報＜丶｀\(\forall\)´＞」),
and `Mizuki's \emph{Girl Knowledge Korea Declaration}' (\emph{`Mizuki no
joshi chi Kan sengen'}, 「みずきの女子知韓宣言（´\(\forall\)｀*)」). Of
note is the usage of \emph{emoji} signifiers in the latter three cases
here; another textual tool for making more accessible and appealing what
is in essence highly ideological rhetoric.\footnote{Blogger `Mizuki',
  who has over 221,000 followers on the aptly titled Twitter account
  @mizukikenkan (a transliteration of the Japanese \emph{kenkan} 嫌韓,
  `Hate Korea') holds a \emph{matome}-blog wherein she selectively
  translates Korean reactions to Naver news-articles. `Mizuki's twitter
  account states ``I love Japan. I hate anti-Japanese sentiment. I want
  to calmly keep an eye on the past and the future of this country while
  treating 'facts' as important.'' (\emph{Nihon ga daisukidesu.
  Han'nichi ga daikirai. 'Jijitsu' o daiji ni shite reisei ni kono kuni
  no kako to mirai o mitsumetai.},
  「日本が大好きです。反日が大嫌い。「事実」を大事にして冷静にこの国の過去と未来を見つめたい。」).
  The first article 'Mizuki' posted after an arson attack on an
  animation studio in Kyoto, Japan was on July 19, 2019 0:02 A.M.,
  titled ``{[}Korea's Reaction{]} `Die'. Splashed with gasoline\ldots{}
  The catastrophe of 33 deaths at Kyoto Animation Arson attack''
  (\emph{{[}Kankoku no han'nō{]} `shine' gasorin bukkake\ldots{} keiani
  hōka de 33-nin ga shibō no dai sanji'},
  「【韓国の反応】「死ね」ガソリンぶっかけ\ldots{}京アニ放火で33人が死亡の大惨事」)
  (Mizuki \protect\hyperlink{ref-mizuki_eng._2019}{2019}).}

Some of those media platforms have however reacted to those trends by
implemented specific terms of services that prohibit inciting violence
or hate. Users have the option to report content, and based on the
amount of reports will those platforms then automatically \emph{flag},
block or remove accounts and their associated content. The colloquial
`Netto-Uyoku ban' (\emph{neto-uyo ban matsuri} ネトウヨBAN祭り, lit.
`Netto-Uyoku Ban Festival') is one such instance of grassroots activism
based around those methods (in the context of 2channel, \emph{matsuri}
祭り refers to a large-scale online meeting with a particular purpose
such as `attacking' a self-perceived other). The \emph{Asahi shinbun}
reported in 2018 a large scale deletion of YouTube channels, including
that of Toranomon News regular Takeda Tsuneyasu (Shino
\protect\hyperlink{ref-shino_eng:_2018}{2018}). A trend amongst deleted
videos was the usage of automated voices and text scrolling over a black
background or several images. Furthermore, a look at the list of removed
accounts reveals a slight majority of accounts with unrelated Western
user-names (such as the most recent deleted accounts `Sandy Kerrigan',
`Beauty Eansworth', `Erica Bray' and `Vickie Cooper'), with a high ratio
of uploaded videos in comparison to the amount of subscribers (ハンJ
Wiki \protect\hyperlink{ref-j_wiki_completed_2019}{2019}), which
strongly suggests the usage of double accounts (\emph{sockpuppets}) and
bots, in similar fashion to what Schäfer, Evert, and Heinrich
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-schafer_japans_2017}{2017}) have previously
suggested.

This was followed by a \emph{Sankei shinbun} tabloid reporting over 2000
YouTube channels and 2000 Twitter accounts suspended (including that of
Zaitokukai's Sakurai Makoto and the two accounts referenced back in
\textbf{figure \ref{fig:twitter}}), with over 50 million tweets deleted
and cited damage to channels such as \emph{Bōkoku no ījisu}
(「某国のイージス」, lit. `A Certain Country's Isis'),\footnote{This
  user runs a Twitter-account @defendjapan and is the owner of the above
  mentioned YouTube accounts `Funny Anti-Japan Channel' (\emph{omoshiro
  han'nichi chan'neru} 「おもしろ反日チャンネル」) and the English
  「Good morning Korea channel」. Both channels remain as of July 16, 2019
  unaccessible. Moreover, this user has contributed writings to at least
  16 different volumes of Japanism.} that of Kazuya and Toranomon News
(Ogawa \protect\hyperlink{ref-ogawa_eng._2019}{2019}) and Tony Marano
(known as \emph{tekisasu oyaji} テキサス親父 or `Texas
Daddy').\footnote{As the content is not explicitly, verbally
  classifiable as inciting hate or violence, the accounts of Takeda
  Tsuneyasu, Kazuya and Toranomon News have since been restored.} In a
final diversion, the latter is worth expanding upon as another source of
`foreign' positive self-confirmation. Various publications have been
accredited to Tony Marano, including several columns in Japanism, a book
co-authored by Toranomon News associate Kent Gilbert (\emph{Subarashī
kuni ・ Nihon ni tsugu!} 『素晴らしい国・日本に告ぐ！』, lit.
``Wonderful Country, I'll Inform japan!'') and an article co-authored by
Hyakuta Naoki (\emph{Asahi no ianfu hōdō o danzai suru!}
「朝日の慰安婦報道を断罪する！」, lit. ``We condemn the Asahi Comfort
Women Report!'').\footnote{The latter was published by the monthly
  magazine \emph{WiLL}, whose regular contributors include Toranomon
  News hosts and regular guests Fujii Genki, Kent Gilbert, Seki Hei,
  Jōnen Tsukasa and Sakurai Yoshiko. It wouldn't be far-fetched to claim
  a pattern here.} On his main English account `PropagandaBuster', Tony
Marano writes ``In an attempt to counter political correctness from the
news media, I will examine propaganda masquerading as truth in the
America news media. Also explore and expose the mental disorder of
liberalism and political correctness infecting Hollywood, academia, and
the re-education camps (public schools). Unchecked far left liberals in
the United States are the single cause for the rapid decline of this
nation, we must counter their leftist, anti-American ideology on every
level.'' A textbook example of neo-nationalism on the Internet, and if
translated in a Japanese context, a textbook example of
Netto-Uyoku rhetoric.\footnote{On July 16, 2019, a YouTube Japan search (on an
  unrelated IP address and device, not logged in YouTube, to ensure our
  results were unaffected by personal Google search queries) for
  「韓国」 (South Korea) and 「日本」 (Japan) did respectively return
  his latest video \emph{jimaku {[}Tekisasu oyaji{]} Kankoku ni `on o
  kyū de kaesa reru' Nihon} (「字幕【テキサス親父】
  韓国に「恩を仇で返される」日本」, lit. ``Subtitled 【Texas daddy】
  This is how South Korea repays Japan?'') as the \nth{3} and \nth{4}
  result.}

The users behind the `Netto-Uyoku ban' are users that identify
themselves with particular subcategories of 2channel, including the
aforementioned \emph{kenmō} board (「嫌儲」), the South Korean-centered
board \emph{hanguru} (「ハングル」) and a board designed for the
discussion of baseball \emph{Nandemo jikkyō (jupitā)} 「なんでも実況
(ジュピター)」. Moreover, while discussion on their activities happens
on 2channel, they are using MediaWiki software to organize
themselves and to inform others on grassroots-level methods to counter what they
deem to be Netto-Uyoku carriers of hate-speech. Those users have not
just reported and documented YouTube and Twitter accounts they deemed
belonging to Netto-Uyoku users, but by reporting blogs and other
websites using means like Google's Adsense, they effectively block the
income of such accounts. Furthermore, on their Wiki-homepage they have
explicitly called out for the revision of Netto-Uyoku leaning Wikipedia
articles (「ネトウヨのウィキペディアの偏向記事を改善するんだ」
``\emph{neto-uyo no wikipedia no henkō kiji o kaizen surunda}'', lit.
``We're improving the Wikipedia articles with Netto-Uyoku
inclinations'') (hangul.shoutwiki.com
\protect\hyperlink{ref-hangul.shoutwiki.com_wikipedia_2019}{2019}).

\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion-2}

Like elsewhere in the world, Wikipedia as a platform and the software
structure behind it are increasingly relevant to Japanese Internet
users' methods for informing oneself. Nevertheless, as demonstrated on
the previous pages political topics are dominantly revised by a small
group of Wikipedia users in order to express political ideology and
influence the public opinion. We have in this chapter further shown ties
between editors on the Japanese Wikipedia and 2channel, both in methods
of organization (high tendencies for editing anonymously as well as
using MediaWiki platforms for meta-discussions on Wikipedia) and in
taking one's usage of 2channel as a source of pride and identity.
Neither are these users expressing their interests on Wikipedia
exclusively around political topics, with either having a history
of editing topics on popular culture, or explicitly referencing those
topics on their profile. The dominance of the Japanese culture industry
is further proven by the high percentage of articles and edits devoted
to such topics like Japanese animation and idol formations. Furthermore,
in a \emph{New York Times} interview, Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales
himself asserted that about 80 percent of Japanese Wikipedia articles
were devoted to pop culture (Cohen
\protect\hyperlink{ref-cohen_wikipedia_2009}{2009}). The time-line of
increase in edits on contentious topics then too generally falls in line
with our hypothesis that the years of 2009 - 2011 were crucial for pushing through the now hegemonic ideology of neo-nationalism. Moreover, due to the
ease of intersection with other language versions of Wikipedia, the most
dedicated among those editors attempt the same thing on a global scale.
Something that is not done solely as an expression of (Japanese)
nationalism, either. The international reach of soft-power strategies
for disseminating the hegemonic ideology lead to such phenomena of
neither ethnically Korean or Japanese citizens trying to tip the balance
of information-making in favor of either nation.

This chapter has
further drawn attention to the technical structure of the software
behind some of these cyber-communities in which self-socialization and
dispersion of ideology occurs. That is to say, imagined
cyber-communities build around shared ideological values and utilizing
normative rhetorical devices for influencing public opinion on the
Internet as a public sphere. Capitalizing on the early growth of
cyber-nationalism on the most active of 2channel's boards, so called
curated \emph{matome} blogs started aggregating content as being
representative of the online voice, adding attractive titles to draw in
clicks and increase profit through online advertisements. In protest,
parts of those sub-communities relocated and started viewing the
previous board as their imagined Other, resulting in a polarizing effect
amongst its users and enhancing the echo-chamber effect of the
communities \emph{matome} blogs aggregate. As illustrated, this has the
potential to spread like wildfire, enforcing political biases on a
global scale.

As cyber-nationalists spread their ideology throughout civil
society, backed by politicians and capitalized on by populist right-wing
influencers such as those of Toranomon News, so too then did a
counter-ideological grassroots movement attempt to disrupt these trends.
One such expression, the `Ban Matsuri', while still rooted in the
contrarian `new frontier' ideology of the World Wide Web, was formed by
users of the same 2channel community, including those that were deterred
from being aggregated profit-seeking \emph{matome} blogs. Using
MediaWiki for the organization and administration of their
counter-activism, their actions have led to the removal of income for
influential news-aggregation websites and the deletion of thousands of
public YouTube and Twitter accounts, affecting Toranomon News affiliates
as well.

\chapter*{Conclusion}\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Conclusion}

Whereas a rising global right-wing populism, which thematically falls in
line with the wide-spread counter-hegemonic narratives disseminated in
part by cyber-nationalists, took the world by surprise particularly in
2016, this paper argues that that has appeared much earlier in Japan.
More specifically in an outburst of public outrage after events
occurring around 2011---scandals in politics, public media and the 2011
Fukushima Nuclear Disaster. Following various contradictions in post-war
Japan's society, The New Left and student protests influenced by Marxist
scholars shook civil society. Now, anti-intellectual right-wing
populists are (sub-)consciously applying the same Marxist school of
thought. Contradictions in society, beginning with the effects of
alienation in the wake of the Lost Decades, have renewed public
distrust. Within this sphere of alienation and crises of identity,
digital natives built intrinsic cyber-communities with a distinct
anti-establishment discourse---a cyber-discourse rooted in the
contrarian, libertarian mindset that shaped the ideology behind the
Internet in the first place.

The introductory first chapter brings the phenomenon of the Netto-Uyoku
to a global level as a localized expression of what we call
cyber-nationalism, and draws parallels with other such online instances
(and in particular with what is now referred to as the Alt-Right). While
this paper does not at all claim information warfare, populist
demagoguery or nationalism to be new tactics in politics, it does point
out the extent to which this is done on the Internet; fueled by both the
technological peculiarities of the Internet itself and by the rhetoric
formed on Internet subcultures. We further made the argument that the
Internet has seen increasing politicization; ranging from populist usage
of big-data and paid propaganda campaigns operating as \emph{faux}
grassroots activism, to microcosmic counter-culture subcultures;
primarily built (under the influence of Japan's soft power) around the
discussion of Japanese pop-culture and disrupting the public discourse
on political issues. Concretely this paper views the Netto-Uyoku as more
than just a non-nonsensical, fringe right-wing voice on the Internet and
attempted two things. The first was to answer both concrete questions
pertaining the Netto-Uyoku's mode of operation, as well as to its
relationship to politics, the Japanese Internet, its international
counterparts and real-life movements. The second goal was to draw a
theoretical backdrop through which we can read not just the Netto-Uyoku,
but just as well what we have defined as cyber-nationalists in general,
as a distinct form of of neo-nationalism or right-wing populism. That,
indicating here an ideology of nativism, authoritarianism and populism, is
shaped by the underlying logic of the Internet as counter-media or a
counter public sphere.

Through a literature review of a select amount of thematically different
studies on the Netto-Uyoku, this paper portrayed an image of Netto-Uyoku
as mostly male Internet-users organizing themselves primarily around
anonymous, subcultural Web-media as 2channel and Niconico, having ties
with real life expressions of xenophobic sentiment such as the
Zaitokukai, and being supportive of the LDP. A sense of community is
built around rhetorical devices perpetuating the idea of a romanticized
`Japaneseness' while attacking those not fitting of that category as
anti-Japanese (ranging from `traitorous' mass media and the left-wing
politically minded, to the ethnic Korean diaspora and nations as China
and South-Korea). As if used as a shibboleth, failure to adhere to such
rigid, cynical structures gets one ignored at best and labeled
anti-Japanese at worst. Furthermore, with the advent of platforms as
Youtube and Twitter, such rhetoric finds itself spread not just on
`fringe' communities, but on those widespread platforms as well. We
further noted the deeply rooted affinity with the Japanese \emph{otaku}
subculture industry of animation, comics and idol music, which
perpetuates the image of a \emph{nihonjinron}-style of Japanese
uniqueness. Finally, this chapter points out that, although the Netto-Uyoku and ACM did not gain much support from traditional nationalist movements, particularly during the rule of the Democratic Party of Japan, the Liberal Democratic
Party of Japan appealed to Internet-users and fans of such subcultures alike,
while simultaneously reinforcing the discontent felt towards mainstream media.

Not unlike elsewhere across the world, this paper further argued those
communities to be ripe for political exploitation (in the form of a
potential political electorate) by those same right-wing populists.
Whether its Donald Trump's presidential campaigns or the Flemish Vlaams Belang in 2019,
right-wing populists have since the second half of the 2010 gained
considerable support throughout the world by including digital natives
in their campaign strategies. Distinct from national-scale politics in
the United States however, we conclude that in Japan the current
iteration of the LDP administration has successfully capitalized on that
public distress. Although perceived societal contradictions up to the
'90s shook the core of the LDP strong enough to bring about a massive
reform of the voting system, we next argued that from the '90s onwards
societal contradictions between the `hegemonic ideology' and the
perceived reality (seen to its inevitable conclusion with the 2011
Fukushima Nuclear Disaster) brought about a new iteration of the LDP, or
rather one that answered to the counter-hegemonic narrative of the
Japanese cyber-nationalists. The actions of the Netto-Uyoku and the
Zaitokukai have led to public disavowal by Abe Shinzō, yet on
social media the prime minister appeals to those groups by expanding
upon those groups' rising concerns and antagonizing mutual enemies---established forms of media, conservation of the ethnic-Japanese
identity, and both the Korean peninsula and
China.

Nevertheless did this paper demonstrate an awareness of group identity
amongst those who reject the Netto-Uyoku. If the Netto-Uyoku exist and
are to be named, then those who have become aware of this phenomenon and
feel rejection form a group identity too, both in the off-line public
sphere as on the Internet. Offline we have various counter movements
organizing counter-demonstrations. Online we have seen communities form
around exposing and removing Netto-Uyoku means of radicalization (the
fourth chapter refers in particular to the 2018 - 2019 neto-uyo Ban
Festival). It is premature to claim, but perhaps this too can be seen as
a trend of greater political shifts.

For future research, we suggest a more thorough analysis of core, inner-layer
cyber-nationalists whose rhetoric is highly cynical and utilizes
neo-nationalist rhetorical devices often in a comical matter (the
framing of a criminal suspect as ethical Korean in highly unlikely
situations, used jokingly, yet perpetuating such a negative image), and
an outer layer whose rhetoric is on first sight almost identical in
content yet lacking the high doses of cynicism and intertextuality
present in the inner core. Furthermore, there is a possibility of
mocking usage of such rhetoric by those opposed (or at least not
explicitly supportive) of cybernationalists. This distinction requires a
high literacy of such rhetoric, as well as an understanding of the
diverse media-mix that shapes the Japanese Internet (to which quantitative methods of textual analysis of large datamined corpora of
online data are not sufficient).

Moreover, as hinted at throughout this paper, Netto-Uyoku are constantly
fueled by a source of perceived anti-Japanese sentiment coming from in
particular South-Korea and China; nations that are plagued by their own
localized expressions of cyber-nationalism and `troll-armies'. In
similar fashion those latter localized expressions too feed on such
perceived negative sentiment coming from Japan, and one that is very
much rooted in the complicated historical three-way relationship between
these nations. For future research, this paper suggests a comparative
analysis between those, their \emph{modus operandi} and their
interaction.

\subsection{Search Engines in Japan}\label{search-engines-in-japan}

The web-portal Yahoo! Japan (a joint venture between the American Yahoo!
and Son Masayoshi's SoftBank) retains a monopolistic grip on the
Japanese Internet market as one of its most visited websites.
Nevertheless, as seen on \textbf{Figure \ref{fig:searchengine}}, Google
is by far the dominant search engine, more so when taking into account
that Yahoo! Japan's search engine has since 2010 implemented Google's
search engine algorithms (which may account for its increase in market
share since). Results based on Google's statistics can therefore be
argued to effectively reflect the overall interest of Internet users in
Japan.

\subsection{Google Trends}\label{google-trends}

\label{appendix:googletrends}

These graphs indicate peak interest over a duration of time and
contrasts interest thus on a relative scale; it does not scale Japanese
results to worldwide results quantitatively.

\begin{figure}[!htb]

 \centering 
 \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth,trim=4 4 4 4,clip]{images/politictrends.eps}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Figure \ref{fig:politictrends}} suggests a global increase in
public awareness of politics (the frequency of searches in part of the
total amount of searches has practically doubled) and nevertheless with
a distinct majority of search interest in left-wing topics (crossed by
right-wing topics one only in November 2016, in the wake of the
presidential elections). In Japan however, interest in political topics
as measured by Google Trends remains however fairly stable throughout
the line, with one significant peak, again, during the period of the LDP
elections in 2012.

While the alt-right have gained mainstream recognition since, in
particular, the terror attack in Charlottesville, \textbf{Figure
\ref{fig:netto-altright}} and \textbf{Figure
\ref{fig:netto-altright-kor}} suggests that South-Korean and Taiwanese
Internet users have had interests in the topic of Netto-Uyoku as well.

\section{Wikipedia}\label{wikipedia}

\subsection{Wikipedia Reverts}\label{wikipedia-reverts}

In order to calculate contentious Japanese Wikipedia pages I use a
rudimentary way of comparing the total amount of reverts to the total
amount of revisions on a page (limited to articles, I exclude
\emph{namespaces} for pages such as \emph{Userpages}). I wrote a script
in the Java programming language to obtain the top 1000 revised articles
(both in total and during a certain time span). Our dataset is a 5GB
data-dump (\emph{jawiki-20190620-stub-meta-history.xml.gz}) obtained
from \url{https://dumps.wikimedia.org/jawiki/20190620/}. This compressed
file contains an XML file with meta-data of every Japanese Wikipedia
page (such as title, namespace, and revision information) up to
2019-06-20.\footnote{For more information on the elements of this XML
  dump, see
  \url{https://glimmerphoenix.github.io/WikiDAT/pages/meta-history/}.}
Reverts are then based on keywords that indicate revisions to be as such
(`rv', `取り消し', `巻き戻し') in the comments of revisions and are
therefore not completely exhaustive (this would most likely include
reverts of acts of vandalism, but will not include the actual act of
vandalism in which one reverts parts of- or even the complete article).
While this methodologically requires further attention, preliminary
results undeniably show in quantifiable ways particular political topics
to be in the top of so-called `\emph{Wiki edit-wars}'. I ran the script
for each year between the range of 2003 (the beginning of the data-dump)
and 2019. Per year I included levels of controversy based both on the
total amount of revisions and reverts up to that year, as well as solely
on the revisions and reverts committed in that particular frame of time.

For future research, and considering the widespread importance of
Wikipedia as online tool of knowledge and opinion-shaping, this paper
suggests the development of a more precise methodology on approaching,
as a content analysis, Wiki-style media, revisions, reverts and its
users.

\subsection{Japanese Wikipedia Top 50 (as of
2019)}\label{japanese-wikipedia-top-50-as-of-2019}

\label{sec:wikiappendix}

Based on respectively our measurement of controversy (reverts divided by
revisions), the total amount of revisions and the total amount of
reverts, we compiled a list of the 50 highest ranking articles.
